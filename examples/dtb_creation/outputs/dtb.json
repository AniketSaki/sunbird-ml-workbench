Thus, all things on the earth are associated\nthe factors important\nwith air, water and land. Air, water and land are\nfor sustaining the living\ncalled the earth's atmosphere, hydrosphere and\nworld on the earth\nlithosphere, respectively. Moreover, different living\nand for fulfilling their basic\nneeds.

These spheres have\nformed on the earth naturally. We have learnt all\nthis in the previous standards.\nThe atmosphere is the layer of air that surrounds\nthe earth. The surface of the earth comprises water\nand land, that is, the hydrosphere and lithosphere. Of\nthese, the hydrosphere occupies a much larger part\nthan the lithosphere. Figure 1.2 shows the proportion\nLand 29%\nof land and water on the earth's surface.\nWe also look upon these natural components in\nWater 71%\nsolid, liquid and gaseous form as resources. In other\nwords, we use them to fulfil our requirements. Let us\nnow study all these three components in detail. 1.2: Proportion of land and water\nCan you recall ? What are the five layers of the atmosphere?\nAir\nThe air in the atmosphere around the earth contains nitrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide,\nsix inert gases, nitrogen dioxide, sulphur dioxide, water vapour and dust particles. The\ntroposphere contains about 80% of the total mass of gases in the air, while this proportion\nis about 19% in the stratosphere. Further, in the mesosphere and ionosphere, the proportion\nof the mass of gases goes on decreasing. Gases are not found in the exosphere and beyond.\nOther constituents\nof air 0.07%\nArgon 0.9%\nCarbon dioxide\n0.03%\nOxygen 21%\nYou can see that air is a mixture of\nseveral gases and is the chief constituent\nof the earth's atmosphere. Besides these\ngases, air also contains water vapour\nand dust particles. The amount of the\ngases in the air is the greatest near the\nsurface and decreases as we go higher\nand higher from the surface. That is, air\nbecomes rarer at higher altitudes.\nThe proportions of the constituents\nof air and some of their uses are given\nhere.\nNitrogen\n78%\n1.3 : Proportions of the various\ngases in the air\nSome uses of gases in air\n\u2022 Nitrogen - Helps living things \u2022 Argon \u2013 Used in electric bulbs.\nto build the necessary proteins. \u2022 Helium \u2013 Used for obtaining low\nIt is useful in the production of temperature and also for generating\nammonia and in airtight packaging lift in airships.\nof foodstuffs.\n\u2022 Neon \u2013 Used in decorative lights\n\u2022 Oxygen \u2013 Necessary for respiration and for street lighting.\nin living things and for combustion. \u2022 Krypton - Used in fluorescent\n\u2022 Carbon dioxide \u2013 Plants use it for tubes.\nproducing their food.

The atmosphere is a very important filter. It\nallows the light and heat of the sun to reach the earth, which is necessary for\nlife. But it prevents the harmful elements from reaching the earth. It is in the\natmosphere that fog, clouds, snow and rain are produced.\n2\nObserve and discuss.\nWhat is the similarity in the three pictures below?\nUGCB 3595\n1.4: Air pollution\nAll the above pictures show large scale emission\nof smoke through different agencies. This smoke\ndirectly mixes with the atmosphere, disturbing the\nbalance between the constituents of air. This is called\nair pollution. Harmful gases are given out through\ncombustion of fuels in vehicles and in big industries\nand also through incomplete combustion of fuels like\nwood and coal. As a result, air pollution is increasing\nday by day.\nHarmful substances\nreleased in air through\ncombustion of fuels\n\u2022 Nitrogen dioxide\n\u2022 Carbon dioxide\nCarbon monoxide\nSulphur dioxide\n\u2022 Soot\nDo you know?\nOzone layer \u2013 the protective shell\nThere is a layer of ozone (02) gas in\nthe lower part of stratosphere. Ozone gas is\nnot directly useful for the survival of living\nthings, yet it is very important for living\nthings to have this layer of ozone at a high\naltitude around the earth. The ultra violet\nrays coming from the sun are very harmful\nfor living things. The ozone gas absorbs these\nrays. As a result, life on earth is protected.\nThe ozone layer is destroyed if chemical\ngases like carbon tetrachloride or the\nchlorofluorocarbons used in air conditioners\nand refrigerators mix with the air.\nThe 16th of September is celebrated\nas \u201cOzone Protection Day'all over the\nworld to make everyone aware of the\nimportance of ozone.\nIn metropolitan cities like Mumbai,\nPune or Nagpur boards are displayed\nat places of heavy traffic to show\nthe proportions of the various\nconstituents of the air at that place.\nDue to these boards, we can see the\namount of harmful elements in the\nair.\n11-01-2015 7:27\nRamtal mums\nAQI\nPollutants\nOzone\nCO\nNOX\nPM10\nPM2.5\nme NA Carbon Monoxide NA\nUse your brain power!\nWhat would have happened if there were no air on the earth?\nWater\nPurpose for which\nwater is used\nAmount of\n| Water (approx.)\nin litres\nTry this.\n- Bath\n- Brushing teeth\n| - Washing clothes\nand utensils\n- Mopping the floor\n- Drinking\n|- Cooking\nTotal use of water\nObserve how much water is used and\nfor what purposes it is used in your house\nfor a whole day. Record it in a chart like\nthe one shown here. Discuss this data\nin the class. Divide the total amount of\nwater used in your house by the number\nof persons to find out how much water\neach person needs.\nYou will see that it is almost\nimpossible for us to spend even a single\nday without water. We need to drink three\nto four litres of water every day so that all\nour bodily functions run smoothly. Other\nliving things also require water although\nthe amount of water they need may vary\naccording to the size of their body. Thus,\nwe see that water is very important.\nIf hydrogen gas burns in air, it\ncombines with oxygen and water is\nformed. We have learnt about some\ncharacteristics of water in the previous\nstandards.\nIn nature, water occurs in three\nstates. Water does not have colour,\ntaste or odour. Many substances readily\ndissolve in water. Therefore, water is a\nuniversal solvent.\nThe blood of animals and the sap\nin plants contain a very high proportion\nof water. No living thing can survive\nwithout water. Therefore it is said that\n\u2018Water is life.'\nWater available on earth\nPercentage\n97%\nSeas, Oceans\nObserve and discuss.\n2.7%\nGroundwater, ice, Water available\nand water II for drinking\nin other forms \u2661\nfor\nWater available\ndrinking (fresh water)\nTotal\n100%\nSeas and Oceans\nWe cannot use all the water on earth\nbecause seawater is salty. Some water is\nin the frozen state. A very small quantity\nof water is available for drinking. Yet it\nis enough for all living things.\n1.5 : Distribution of water on the earth\nFind out.\nIn what ways is the water in seas and oceans useful even though it is salty ?\nObserve and discuss.\nFor which purposes is water being used ?\nDo other living things use\nwater like we do?\na\nWe use water in large\nquantities. We have learnt\nthat water on the earth is\nregulated through the water\ncycle. The water vapour\nformed from oceans is the\nmain source of water in the\nwater cycle. It gets converted\ninto rain, creating fresh water\nsources on earth.\n1.6 : Uses of water on the earth\nAlways remember...)\nWe get water from natural sources\nsuch as streams, rivers, ponds, springs and\nlakes. Man also digs wells and borewells\nto lift ground water. Apart from this, man\nhas also constructed bunds and dams of\nvarious sizes on rivers.\nDue to the uncontrolled use of water\nfor an increasing population, industry and\nfarming, it is now in short supply. Water\nscarcity has become a serious problem.\n1. Use water sparingly.\n2. Block water, let it percolate.\n3 Store water wherever possible.\n4. Reuse water wherever possible.\nRemember, stored water does not\nbecome stale at once.\n\u2022 What is land made of ? \u2022 Is land flat everywhere?\nCan you tell ? \u2022 What do you see on land ? \u2022 Does man produce soil/land ?\n\u2022 What has man created on land ?\n\u2022 If a deep pit is dug in the ground, what do you find there?\nLand\nLand is seen in the form of stones, soil, big rocks. It is not flat everywhere. It is\nhilly in some places and flat in others. All terrestrial animals including man live on\nland. Some terrestrials dig burrows in the ground for shelter. This means that they use\nland for fulfilling their need. We also use land for farming and for building houses and\nroads. We make use of plants and animals in the forests that grow on land. The\nminerals, crude oil and natural gas obtained from the earth (land) are very important\nfor us. It means that land is an important resource. Let us see exactly what land is\nmade of.\n( 5 )\nSoil\n1. Take a transparent plastic bottle, a\nLet's try this.\nhandful of soil, some stones, sand, some\ndry leaves and water.\n2.

If a top to bottom?\npipeline is being laid in your neighbourhood,\nobserve carefully the pits dug for this\npurpose. You will see some layers under the\nland surface, as shown in the accompanying\nfigure.\n- Humus\nIf the land has mature soil, the topmost\nlayer is formed by the decomposition of the\nremains of plants and animals. This layer is\nImmature\ncalled 'humus'. It is usually found in dense\nforests. The land below this is full of sand,\nsoil, small stones, worms, and insects. Soil\nand pieces of bedrock are found below this\nLayer of\nlayer of land. This soil is immature. Further\nsoil and\nbelow this layer the proportion of soil\nsmall rocks\ndecreases and that of rock increases. This is\nthe layer of bedrock. The main minerals in\nthe soil are derived from these rocks. That is\nwhy, soil in different regions is different. The\nBedrock\ncolour and texture of soil are both determined\nby the bedrock.\n1.8 : Layers of land\nThe process of soil formation\nThe soil on the land is formed by a natural process. The abiotic components of soil are\nsupplied through the weathering of the bedrock. Due to the heat, cold and water of the sun,\nwind and rain respectively, the bedrock breaks down into pieces. Stones, sand and soil are\nformed from these pieces. Microbes, worms and insects are found among them. Rodents\nlike mice and rats are also found here. The roots of trees growing on the land also help\nweathering of rocks. The process of soil formation is slow and continuous. It takes about\na thousand years for a 2.5 cm thick layer of mature soil to form.\n0\nsoil\nO\nSoil can get destroyed in a short period due to floods, storms and human activities\nsuch as mining. That is why, it is necessary to conserve soil and to prevent erosion of\nland. The best remedy for this is to increase the green cover of the land. Erosion of land is\nreduced if grass, trees and bushes are grown in it.\nve Try this.\nObtain specimens of soil from various places in your surroundings\nsuch as your own yard, a garden, hills, river banks, fields and\nrocky ground. Note the differences in the specimens with respect\nto colour, feel, texture and the size of the particles.\nDo you know?\nUse your brain power!\nHumus is the layer formed on soil due to the\ndecomposition of dead plants and animals\nby microbes. Humus supplies nutrients\nto the soil. Humus is also important for\naerating the soil and for holding water in\nthe soil. The proportion of humus in the\nupper layer of good fertile soil is about 33%\nto 50%.\nWhat are the constituents of soil ?\nClassify them as biotic and abiotic\nconstituents.\nForests on land got buried underground due to the great upheavals that took place\non the earth many ages ago. After that, the process of formation of fossil fuels\nfrom the remains of living things took place underground. We get fuels like petrol,\ndiesel, kerosene, paraffin and other useful materials like tar and wax from\nthe fossil fuel called crude oil.\nLiving things use land, water and air\navailable on earth and so does man. However,\nthe portions of these resources that are actually\nput to use are very small as compared to the\nwhole earth. Look at the following table.\nLand\n29%\nPotable water / fresh water 0.3%\nOxygen\n21%\nEven in these small proportions, the\nresources shown in the above table are\nsufficient for all living things. Only, it is very\nnecessary for man to control his greed. In other\nwords, he must use these resources judiciously,\nwith the awareness that they are meant for all\nother living things and not just for mankind.\nInstitutes at work\nIndia Meteorological\nDepartment (IMD) was\nestablished in 1875 for studying\nthe weather in the Indian\nsubcontinent. The main function\nof this institute is to observe the\nweather and to make weather\nforecasts. This institute also\nconducts research related to\nchanges in weather, makes\nforecasts about rains and studies\nthe developments related to\nglobal warming\nWhat we have learnt-\n\u2022 The elements available in nature\nwhich fulfil the basic needs of living\nthings are called natural resources.\nAir, water and land are important\nnatural resources.\nSoil has both biotic and abiotic\nconstituents.\n\u2022 There are many constituents of air such\nas nitrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide,\ninert gases, water vapour and dust\nparticles.\n\u2022 The ozone layer is a protective shell of\nthe earth.\n\u2022 Natural resources should be used\ncarefully and sparingly.\nExercise\n1.

As they grow, some plants\ndevelop branches while others do not.\nThough all living things grow, animals grow\nonly for a certain period. Plants, on the other\nhand, grow as long as they live. The growth of\nliving things occurs from within the body, which\nmeans that growth occurs in all parts of the body.\n2.3 : Sapling in a pot\n2.4: Growth in banyan and coconut trees\nUse your brain power!\nWhat differences do you see in the growth of trees like the mango, banyan\nand peepal and that of the bamboo, coconut and toddy palms.\nSunlight\nOxygen\nFood is necessary for growth\nPlants make their own food in\nsunlight. Plants produce food from\nwater, nutrients in the soil and the\ncarbon dioxide present in the air.\nThis process takes place in the\nleaves of plants. It is brought about\nin the presence of sunlight, with the\nhelp of the chlorophyll in the leaves.\nThis process of food production is\ncalled photosynthesis.

What is the unused part of food converted into ?\nExcretion\nWaste substances are formed during the many processes\nthat take place in the bodies of animals. These are called excreta\nand the process of eliminating them from the body is called\nexcretion. Animals have specific organs for excretion.\nPlants, too, excrete. For example, some plants shed leaves\nin a specific season. Waste substances stored in the leaves of\nplants are shed along with the leaves.\n2.8 : A tree shedding leaves\n(11)\nTry this.\nTake a transparent plastic bag.

If you suddenly enter a\ncowshed, the cows and buffalos stand up, begin to\nmove, one or two may even start mooing. These\nare all movements.\nA creeper planted in the courtyard leans towards\na support. A potted plant placed in a window grows\ntowards sunlight. It means that plants, too, show\nmovement. Living things move of their own accord.\nThe movement or the change taking place in\na living thing at such a time is their response to a\nstimulus. An event that occurs in our surroundings is\na stimulus. The ability of living things to respond to\na stimulus is called their responsiveness to stimuli.\nA potted plant\n2.10: Responsiveness and movement\nPS\nUse your brain power!)\n1.

Later on\nin life reproduction stage, their organs become weak and still later, their life comes to\nan end. In other words, living things die. The lifespans of different animals and plants\nare different. For example, the lifespan of the dog is about 12 to 18 years, while the\nostrich lives for 50 years.\nYou may have wondered what exactly the living things are, how they came into\nbeing, and so on.\n13\nDo you know?\nThe lifespan of the giant turtle found on\nthe Galapagos Island in South America\nis about 170 years. On the other hand,\nthe lifespan of the mayfly ranges from\n(1 hour to 24 hours.\nopy Can you tell ?\nObserve a honeycomb and a wall.\nWhat are they made of ?\nYou may have seen the small\ncompartments of a honeycomb. These\ncompartments are joined together to form\na honeycomb. A wall has bricks. To\nconstruct a wall, we firmly join the bricks\ntogether.\n2.13 : A wall\nA honeycomb\nA cellular structure\nLiving things are made of small units called cells. All the co\nactions and processes in the bodies of living things are brought\nAmoeba\nabout with the help of these microscopic cells.\nSome living things are made of a single cell. These are called\nunicellular organisms. On the other hand, the living things that\nParamoecium\nare made of many cells are called multicellular organisms. The\namoeba and some other microorganisms are unicellular while\nman, cow, mouse, cockroach, elephants, banyan tree, the onion\nplant, etc. are all multicellular organisms. All the characteristics\nof living things are seen in every cell of a living thing, whether it\nis unicellular or multicellular.\nCellular structure is the main characteristic of living things,\neven though the number of cells may vary.\n2.14 : Various living things\n(14)\nInstitutes at work\nThe institutes that work for the survey and conservation of the various plants\nand animals in different parts of India are the Botanical Survey of India (1890)\nand the Zoological Survey of India (1916) respectively. In case you\nfind an unfamiliar plant or animal in your surroundings, you can\ncommunicate with these institutes to obtain more information about it.\nU\nCan you tell ? In what way are plants and animals useful to us ?\nVasaka\n2.15 : Useful living things\nUseful living things\nPlants are used for household as\nwell as industrial purposes. For example,\nfenugreek (methi), potato, okra (bhendi),\napple, banana are used as food while\nvasaka (adulsa), hirada, behada, asparagus\nare used as medicines.\nAnimals are also useful to us. Dogs,\ncats, cows, buffalos are kept for domestic\nuses. Fish, sheep, fowl are used as food,\nwhile animals like horses, oxen, camel\nprove useful in various occupations. The\nearthworm is very useful in agriculture.\nHarmful living things\nSome animals and plants around\nus are harmful to man. For example,\nmosquitoes and flies spread diseases.\nCockroaches, mice, rats destroy our food.\nLice, ticks also spread diseases. The bites\nof some poisonous lizards, spiders, snakes\nand scorpions can even cause death. If\nwild elephants enter human settlements,\nthey cause a lot of destruction.\nSome plants, too, can be harmful, as\nfor example, the dodder, parthenium and\nother weeds.\nPods of the nettle, colocasia leaves\ncause itching. Plants like oleander, lantana\nhave strong odours. The datura plant is\npoisonous. Uncontrolled growth of fungi\nand algae in water pollutes drinking water\nand may cause the spread of diseases.\nDatura\nColocasia leaves\n2.16 : Harmful living things\nC15\nWild animals\nWild animals that hunt other animals for food\nare called predators, for example, tigers, lions,\nwolves, leopards.

Have a class discussion\nwith reference to the collected information.\n2.17 : Wild animals\nMV Always remember...\nMany plants and animals in nature satisfy our needs. The use of such plants and\nanimals should be restricted only to our needs. We should not pluck leaves, flowers\nand fruit unnecessarily. Animals should not be hunted. They should not be teased\njust for fun. It is the responsibility and duty of all of us to protect plants and animals.\nWhat we have learnt-\nGrowth, respiration, excretion, reproduction, responsiveness to stimuli, movement,\na definite lifespan and a cellular structure are the characteristics of living\nthings.\nAnimals grow for certain period of their life. Plants, however, grow as long\nas they live.\nAnimals have specific organs for respiration, while plants respire through\nmicroscopic pores on their leaves and stems.\n\u2022 The process of eliminating waste products from the body is called excretion.\n\u2022 All living things have the ability to reproduce.\n\u2022 Living things move because of their ability to respond to stimuli.\n\u2022 Plants show spontaneous movements but they cannot leave their place and go\nelsewhere as animals do.\nLiving things have a definite lifespan at the end of which they die.\nMany animals and plants are useful to us in our daily life.

We\nfind that living things exist in all these diverse conditions. When we live in a certain\nplace, we adjust to the conditions there. Various types of living things have survived\nbecause of their ability to adjust themselves to the conditions in their surroundings.\nOY\nCan you tell? Are the plants and animals that you have seen all alike?\nDiversity in plants\nVarious types of plants are found in many places around us. Some plants like grass\nare short, while others are tall and have a canopy. Some plants grow underwater, while\nsome others float on water. We find that some plants grow even in deserts. Moreover, we\nfind that there is a lot of variety in the same type of plant. For example, there are different\nvarieties of rice or wheat, different types of roses, and mangoes of different flavours. Some\nplants grow even without stems, leaves or roots. These are very different from ordinary\nplants. Let us study this diversity among plants.\nPlants make their own food in sunlight. Such plants are called autotrophic plants.\nFor example, the hibiscus, pomegranate, periwinkle, etc. Some plants like funguses,\nloranthus, dodder use other plants for food and are said to be heterotrophic. Plants\nlike the pitcher plant even consume insects. They are insectivorous.\n3.1 : Method of nutrition in plants\n18\nThe structure of a plant\nPlant structure can generally be divided into two parts \u2013 the stem which grows above\nthe ground and the root which grows below the ground surface.\nThe root, stem and leaves are the main parts of plants. From time to time,\nplants bear flowers for reproduction. Flowers are transformed into fruits.\nFruits have seeds. Seeds give rise to new plants.\nThe flower : This\nis the most attractive\npart of a plant. It is\nconnected to the stem\nby a stalk which may be\nlong or short. A flower\nhas a typical colour and\nshape. The flower is\nan important means of\nreproduction.\nThe leaf : The\nleaf is flat. It plays an\nimportant role in the\nproduction of food.\nLeaves are mainly of\ntwo types : simple and\ncompound leaves.\nSimple leaf\n(Ex. Hibiscus)\nCompound leaf\n(Ex. Rose)\nThe stem : The\nheight, shape and size of\na plant depends upon the\nstem. The stem carries\nout the functions of\nproduction, conduction\nand storage of food. In\nsome plants, it has the\nfunction of reproduction.\nIt gives support to other\nparts of the plant.\nThe fruit : Fruits\nhave different shapes.\nFruits contain one or\nmore seeds. The pods\nof beans and peas are\nactually fruits.\n3.2 : The structure of a plant\nTU\nThe root : Roots hold the soil firmly and anchor\nthe plant. The main functions of the root are to absorb\nand transport water and nutrients from the soil. The\nroots of the carrot and radish also store food. There are\ntwo types of roots : taproot and fibrous root.\nTaproot Fibrous root\n(Hibiscus, Banyan) (Onion, Grass)\nNeed for classification of plants\nUp to now, information about lakhs of plants has been collected. While studying\nthe diversity in plants, they are classified for the sake of convenience on the basis of the\nsimilarities and differences in their structure, their organs and their other characteristics.\n19\nThe scientist Carolus Linnaeus made the first scientific classification of plants.\nInitially, it was his method of classification that was used by all.\nTake a round through a garden or in your surroundings\nObserve and discuss.\nand list the plants that you see. Draw their pictures as\nwell. Draw a table as shown below and complete it on the basis of the information you\ngather. Discuss it in the class.\nName | Where Nature of the Height Branches Leaves Flowers Nature of Uses\nof the does stem (Short, | (Nature, | (Colour, (Colour, the fruit (Which\nplant the (Circumference, medium, number, shape, fragrance, | (Colour, part is\nplant | colour, bark, very tall, etc.) edge, shape, etc.) shape, used.)\noccurl | hard/soft, etc.) | etc.)\netc.)\nhardness\nor softness,\netc.)\ngrow\nRose\nClassification of plants\nWe can easily notice the\ndifferences in the shape and height\nof the plants in our surroundings.\nIt is easy to classify the plants on\nthe basis of this observation.\n3.3 : Diversity in plants\nCan you tell 2 1. What are the similarities between a mango,\na banyan and a tamarind tree?\nTrees : Some plants grow tall. Their stem, or trunk, is hard\nand strong. They have branches at some height above the\nground. They bear flowers and fruit for many years. Such\nplants are called trees. Trees are tall, big and perennial, i.e.,\nthey live for many years.\n20\n2. What are the similarities between the hibiscus,\noleander and lantana plants ?\nShrubs : Some plants grow close to the ground.\nThey give out branches very close to the ground.\nThey are shorter and smaller than trees, but they\nhave a thick and hard stem. The oleander, hibiscus,\nlantana, koranti and rose are shrubs that may grow\nup to two to three metres.\n3. What are the similarities between the fenugreek\nand periwinkle plants ?\nHerbs : Herbs grow 1 to 1.5 metres tall. The stems of herbs are green and quite flexible as\ncompared to those of trees and bushes. Herbs may live for a few months or up to two years.\nAccording to the size and height of their stems, plants can be classified\ninto three types : trees, shrubs and herbs.\n7 Have you seen vines like the pumpkin, the railroad creeper,\n\u00dcYN Can you tell ?) kavali. watermelon or the grapevine ? How do they grow ?\nVines : Some vines need vertical support for growing,\nso\nwhile some others spread on the ground. Climbers like the\nmoney plant have aerial roots. Have you seen the cucumber\ntendrils that look like a spring ? Of what use could they be?\nTouch the stem of any vines. What do you feel ?\n4\nThe stem of a creeper is w\nvery flexible, soft and green.\nIt grows rapidly with the help\nof a support.\nAlle a\n32\n3.4 : Various creepers and climbers\nCan you tell?\nCan you tell 2 For how many years do crops like bajra, wheat,\ncorn, radish, marigold live?\nThe lifecycle of plants like jowar, sunflower is completed in one year.\nThese plants are called annuals. The lifecycle of plants like the carrot,\nbeetroot is of two years. They are called biennials. Shrubs like the hibiscus\nand oleander and trees like mango and gulmohur live for several years and\nbear flowers and fruit. They are called perennials.\nAccording to the period of their lifecycle, plants are classified as\nannuals, biennials, perennials.\n21 )\nOye Can you tell? To which part of plants are butterflies and insects attracted ?\nPlants that bear flowers are called flowering plants, while the plants\nthat never bear flowers are called non-flowering plants. Non-flowering\nplants may not have organs like roots, stems, leaves.\nUse your brain power! )\n\u2022 What type of plants are\ntoadstools and mushrooms ?\n\u2022 What type of plant is the\nfig?\n\u2022 Do ferns, algae, money\nplant bear flowers ?\nDo you know?)\nThe world's largest flower is found in\nIndonesia. The diameter of the flower of the\nplant Rafflesia arnoldi is about one metre. The\nworld's smallest flower is of the plant called\nWolffia or duckweed. Its diameter is as small\nas 0.5 mm.\nCan you tell ?\n1. Where does the pomegranate shrub grow? 2. Where does the lotus grow ?\n3. Where do bulrushes, the railroad creeper grow? 4. Where does the dodder plant grow?\nWe see different plants growing in different places around us. Plants can be\nclassified according to their habitat or the place where they grow. Land, water, marshy\nareas, deserts and even a big tree are the various habitats of plants.\nWater\nLand\nA desert\nUse your brain power!\n\u2022 Why does the water hyacinth float\non water?\n\u2022 Why is the stem of the cactus fleshy ?\n\u2022 What different criteria are used to\nclassify plants ?\n3.5: Habitats of plants\n(22)\nDiversity and classification in animals\nDifferent animals have developed different shapes to survive in the environment.\nThere is a great variety in the body structure of animals too. The amoeba that cannot\nbe seen with our eyes, the huge elephant, the small snail, the fish that swims in water,\na kite that flies high in the sky, butterflies that flit around flowers, a house lizard that\ncrawls on a wall are all animals. Each has different characteristics.\nAnimals have body parts like a head, a neck, a torso, a tail and limbs for movement.\nThey have various organ systems which carry on various functions inside their body.\nIn this respect, too, there is a lot of diversity in animals.\nCan you tell ?\nn\nGOD\nWhat are the differences in the\nbody structure of animals like\na snake, a lizard, a tiger, a fish, an\neagle, a hen, a crab, a housefly,\nan earthworm, a crocodile and a\ngrasshopper?\nWe see a variety in animals\nwith respect to their food as well.\nSince animals depend on others for\ntheir food, they are found in places\nwhere food is available. Different\nanimals have different methods of\nobtaining and eating food. This,\ntoo, leads to differences in their\nbody structure.\nTry this.\n3.6 : Diversity in animals\nObserve the animals in your surroundings.

What do you see?\nTry this.\nWhen a drop of water from a puddle is seen under a\nmicroscope, innumerable microbes can be seen moving about in it.\nYou will see the continuously moving amoeba. The paramoecium\nis also a unicellular animal like the amoeba.\nA horse, a bear, a tortoise are multicellular animals.\nUpCan you tell ?\n1. What is the chain of bones in the centre of our back\ncalled ?\nAnimals with a vertebral column and those without\nit form two groups known as the vertebrates and\ninvertebrates, respectively.\nSnakes, birds, fish and kangaroos as also humans are\nvertebrate animals. Animals such as snails, cockroaches,\nearthworms do not have a vertebral column and therefore\nthey are invertebrate animals.\n2. Name some animals which lay eggs and others which\ngive birth to their young ones.\nWe have learnt that producing another living thing like\noneself is called reproduction. A hen lays eggs and hatches\nthem. After a few days, the young chicks hatch out of the\neggs. A cow gives birth to a calf. Before that, the calf\ngrows within the cow's body. According to the mode of\nreproduction, animals are classified into two types, namely,\noviparous animals which lay eggs and viviparous animals\nwhich give birth to their young ones.\n3. Where are the animals, namely, a horse, a bear, a tortoise, an alligator, a fish,\na deer and a frog to be found ?\nAccording to their habitat, animals are usually classified into\nterrestrial and aquatic animals. However, animals like a frog,\nsalamander, toad live in both places, namely, land and water.\nTherefore, they are called amphibious animals.\nA kite, an eagle, a crow, a butterfly, a honeybee all fly in the air, though they live in\ndifference places. These animals are said to have an aerial mode of life.\nWhat are the different criteria used to classify\nUse your brain power!) animals ?\n(24)\nAlways remember...\nWhat we have learnt-\nIn the living world, a lot of diversity\nis seen both in animals and plants.\nEvery plant and animal is unique. We\nshould all make efforts to conserve\nthis diversity in the living world.\n\u2022 Plants are classified on the basis of their\nheight and the shape of stems, period of\nlife cycle and habitat.\nAnimals are classified on the basis of the\ncell structure, vertebral column, method\nof reproduction and habitat.\nExercise\n1.

Willard Gibbs showed that the\ncharacteristic properties of a substance\ndepend on its physical state and the\narrangement of particles in it.\n(32)\n| Points\nSolids\nLiquids\nGases\nExample LA piece of iron\nWater, spirit, oil\nAir\nShape Has a shape of its own.

On gaining\nheat the substance changes from solid\nto liquid and liquid to gas. On the other\nhand, when the substance cools, or loses\nheat, it changes from gaseous to liquid\nand liquid to solid state.\nChanges of state\non heating on heating\nSolid 2 Liquid = Gas\non cooling on cooling\nCan you tell ?\n50\n120-\n100\nThe temperature and\na thermometer\nWhen a substance gets heat, it\nbecomes warm and then hot. We\nput our hand or finger in the water\nto judge how hot it is, but that is not\nan accurate measure. Besides, if the\nsubstance is very hot, we could get\nscalded.\nA thermometer is used to\nmeasure temperature. Degrees\nCelsius (\u00b0C) is the unit of measuring\ntemperature. There are several\ntypes of thermometers available.\nNowadays digital thermometers are\nfrequently used.\nDoes water change into\nvapour the moment we place\nthe vessel on a stove ? Does\nwater kept in fridge change\nat once into ice ?\nA specific amount of\nheat must be gained or lost\nbefore the state of a substance\ncan change. The change in\nphysical state is determined\nby how hot the substance\nbecomes on gaining heat, or\nhow cold, on losing it.\nHow do we tell how hot or\ncold a substance is ?\n.\n..\nl\nl\nIl\nMercury\n368TC\n5.3 : Thermometer\n33.\nLet's try this.\nTake a thermometer from the laboratory. The bulb at\nThermometer\nits lower end is filled with mercury. The mercury rises to\na certain level in the capillary tube above the bulb. You\nwill see a scale next to the mercury column. Reading\nthe figure near the level of the mercury tells us the\ntemperature of air around the bulb of the thermometer.\nHold the thermometer in water so that the bulb\nIce\nis completely immersed in the water and read the\ntemperature of the water. Repeat the activity taking\nsome hot water in one vessel, and cold water or ice in\nanother. Note the temperatures.\n5.4 : Recording the temperature\nSome examples\nTemperature\nBoiling water\n100 \u00b0C\nFreezing water\n0 \u00b0C\nAir (winter night) <15 \u00b0C\nAir (summer afternoon) >35 \u00b0C\nInside a fridge\n<5 \u00b0C\nInside the freezer <-18 \u00b0C\nBody temperature Approx. 37 \u00b0C ( Do be careful !\n100\u00b0C\nThermometer\nBoiling\nWater is continuously evaporating. We know that\nwater spilled on the floor dries up slowly on its own.\nThis evaporation occurs from the surface of the water.\nWhat happens when water boils? As the water\ngets heated, its temperature increases and it evaporates\nat a faster and faster rate.\nWhen water kept on a stove attains a particular\ntemperature or level of heat, then evaporation takes\nplace in all parts of the body of water. Then we see\nwater bubbles rising at faster and faster rates to the\nsurface and steam mixing in the air. This is called\nboiling of water or ebullition. At sea-level, pure water\nboils at 100\u00b0C. This is the boiling point of water. When\nwater vapour cools, it is converted into water again.\nThis process is called condensation. Condensation of\nsteam also takes place at 100\u00b0C. It means that the\nboiling point and condensation point of water are one\nand the same.\n( 34\nBoiling\nwater\n50\u00b0C\nBurner\n20\u00b0C\n5.5 : Boiling\nLet's try this.\nWhile gaining heat\nBoiling\nMelting\nGas\nVapour\nLiquid\nSolid\nTake some water in a beaker and\nplace a thermometer in it. Heat the beaker\non a spirit lamp. Note the boiling point of\nwater. Repeat the activity, adding salt or\nsugar to the water and note the boiling\npoint again. What do you infer from it?\nCondensation\nFreezing\nWhile losing heat\nUse your brain power!\nThe chart given below shows the\nboiling point and freezing point of\nsome substances. State whether these\nsubstances are solid, liquid or gaseous\nat room temperature.\nFreezing\nThe water kept in a fridge or on\nice becomes cooler and cooler, that\nis, its temperature falls. At a certain\ntemperature, water does not get any\ncooler, but starts freezing and forms ice.\nThe temperature at which this happens, is\ncalled the freezing point of water.\nThe temperature of a substance can\nfall below 0\u00b0C, e.g., the temperature of air\nin the freezer of a refrigerator is around\n-18\u00b0C. It is read as 'minus 18 degrees\nCelsius'.\nWhen ice gets heat, it starts melting\nor changing into the liquid state again. Ice\nmelts at 0\u00b0C. It means that the freezing\npoint and melting point of water are one\nand the same.\nEach substance has a specific boiling\npoint which is also its condensation point.\nEach substance has a specific\nmelting point which is the same as its\nfreezing point.\nSubstance Freezing point | Boiling point\nCandle 60\u00b0C\n350\u00b0C\nPlastic >250\u00b0C\n954\u00b0C\nIron 1535\u00b0C 2862\u00b0C\nto\nVarious uses of changes in physical\nstate\n1. Candles are made by melting paraffin\nwax.\n2. Solid carbon dioxide (dry ice) is used\nto make ice cream and to keep it\nfrozen.\n3. Liguid nitrogen is used in animal\nhusbandry.\n4. Sand (silica) is melted to make glass.\n5. Metals like gold and silver are melted\nto make ornaments.\n6. Iron is melted to make tools.\nThe temperature at which\na substance boils while heating\nis the same as the temperature at\nwhich it condenses when it is cooled.\nSimilarly, the temperature at which\na substance freezes while cooling\nis the same as the temperature at\nwhich it melts when it is heated.\n35\nY Let's try this.\nTake some sand in a crucible. Put a few iodine crystals on it.\nPlace the crucible on a tripod to heat it. Block the stem of the\nfunnel with a cotton plug and place it inverted over the crucible. Light the burner and\nheat the mixture in the crucible. Observe the changes.\nWhy does this happen?\nR- Cotton plug\nSublimation\nIodine crystals do not melt on\nheating but change directly to the\nIodine\ngaseous state.

They can be\nput to use according to their properties.\nLet's study the properties of\nsubstances in greater detail.\n5.7 : Identifying various substances and objects\n36\nProperties of substances.\nLet's try this.\nor\n5.8 : Brittleness\n5.9 : Hardness\nWhat will happen if pressure is applied on\nsubstances like chalk, brick, alum, glass or a\nrajgira wadi ? These substances break into small\npieces or particles. Such substances are said to\nbe brittle. This property of substances is called\nbrittleness.\nTake an iron nail. Try to pierce a cardboard\nsheet, wet mud and a piece of wood using the\nnail. What happens ? The nail easily pierces wet\nmud, but not the piece of wood. It can pierce\nthe cardboard sheet with some effort. Why does\nthis happen? The hardness of a substance is\ndetermined by how much resistance it offers to\nthe substances being pushed through it.\nWhich is the hardest known substance ?\n\u2022 Stretch a rubber band and let it go or apply\npressure on a piece of sponge and release it.\nWhat do you see? The rubber band and the\nsponge go back to their original shape. Some\nsubstances change their shape when a force\nis applied on them but return to their original\nshape and size when the force is removed. This\nproperty is called elasticity.\nTake a flat metal sheet of the size of a notebook.\nHolding it at an angle, put a drop of water,\nhoney and gum at different places on the board.\nObserve how they flow down the slope. Liquids\nflow downward on a sloping surface. This\nproperty is called fluidity. The fluidity of any\nliquid is determined by how easily it flows.\n5.10 : Elasticity\n5.11 : Fluidity\nIf two blocks of the same size, one wooden and the other of iron, are weighed in\na balance, how would they compare ? The mass of different substances having the\nsame volume can be different. This difference is because of the difference in their\ndensities. Between substances of the same volume, the ones with greater density are\nheavier than the those of lesser density.\n(37)\nKerosene\nWater\n\u2022 Take a glass of water. Add some salt, fine\nsand and sugar to it and try to dissolve\nthem. Repeat this, replacing water with\nkerosene. What do you observe ? Some solid\nsubstances dissolve in a particular liquid. If\na solid does not dissolve in a liquid, it is\nsaid to be insoluble in that liquid e.g. salt is\nsoluble in water, but insoluble in kerosene.\nYou know of many beverages, made by\nusing water and soluble substances. The\nproperty of a substance of getting dissolved,\nis called its solubility.\n\u2022 When we can look through a substance and see\nthings on the other side, then that substance\nis said to be transparent. This property of\nthe substance is called transparency. Glass,\nsome types of plastic, clean water and air\nare transparent substances.\n5.12 : Solubility\nUna Can you tell ?\n5.13 : Transparency\nIdentify the objects shown in figure 5.14.\nFrom which substances are they made ? What\nare these substances called as a group ?\nMetals : Substances like copper, gold, iron,\naluminium are called metals. Metals are found\nin the form of minerals deep inside the earth.\nMinerals from the earth's crust are processed\nto obtain the metal. In daily life, metals have\nvarious important uses. Let us study some\ncommon properties of metals.\nProperties of metals\n5.14 : Metals\n-\nLet's try this.\nTake a piece of copper or aluminium wire or\na small nail. Hammer it repeatedly. What do\nyou observe ?\nOn hammering repeatedly, the wire\nbecomes flat, i.e., it forms a thin sheet. Metals\ncan be converted into sheets by hammering.\nThis property of metals is called malleability.\n5.15 : Malleability\n( 38\nObserve and discuss.\nHot iron is hammered and made into thin\nsheets. Visit a blacksmith's shop to observe how this\nhammering causes it to stretch. Iron bars made to\nrevolve continuously while being hammered become\nlonger. The iron can be drawn into a wire.\nMetals can be stretched and drawn into wires. This\nproperty of metals is called ductility. Metals like silver,\n5.16 : Ductility\ngold, copper, platinum can be drawn into fine wires.\n1. Why are the electric boards fitted on the wall made of plastic\nCan you tell ?\nor wood ?\n2. The handle of a cooker is made of plastic. Why?\nElectricity flows through metals. All metals are\nconductors of electricity to a greater or lesser extent.\nThis property is called electrical conductivity.\nEven when a piece of a metal is heated at\none place, the whole of it becomes hot. It shows\nthat metals allow heat to flow through them. This\nproperty is called thermal conductivity.\nMetals have a typical shine or lustre. Every\nmetal has a characteristic colour by which it can\nbe identified.\nTry this.\n5.17 : Thermal conductivity\n1. Pluck the string of a musical instrument like\na tanpura or veena, ring a bell or hit a steel\nbox with a metal spoon.\n2. Strike a wooden table or a marble floor\nwith a wooden stick.\nNote the difference in the sounds\nproduced in the two cases.\nMetals produce a ringing sound. This\nproperty is called the sonority of metals.\n5.18 : Uses of metals\nWhat we have learnt-\nP\nT Always remember...)\nDuring the rainy season or at\nany other time, do not touch the\nexposed electric wires or metal\nparts.\nKeep all electric lamps or other\nappliances switched off when not\nin use. For example, even when\nthe TV is switched off by remote\ncontrol, do not forget to put off\nthe main switch. It helps to save\nelectricity besides protecting us\nfrom any possible danger.\nAsk your seniors at home to\ncheck the electric wiring and\nfittings in the house periodically.\n| \u2022 Solids, liquids and gases are the three\nstates of substances.\n\u2022 The temperature of a substance, (how\nhot or cold it is), can be measured with\nthe help of a thermometer.\n\u2022 Heat is the cause of the change of state\nof substances.\n\u2022 Substances have various properties like\nhardness, elasticity, brittleness, fluidity,\ndensity, solubility and transparency.\n\u2022 Metals form a separate group of\nsubstances.\n\u2022 Metals have some common properties\nlike malleability, ductility, thermal\nconductivity, electrical conductivity,\nsonority, lustre, and characteristic\ncolour.\nScience watch ...\nScience is developing continuously. How much do we know of it ? Research work\ngoes on at the State, national and global level. If we wish to keep ourselves informed\nabout it, we must be aware of the various happenings around us.

Objects are made up of substances.\nObjects have a specific shape, their parts have a\nspecific arrangement, by which we identify them.\nWe use wood, plastic or steel, to make a table,\nchair or cupboard. These substances have the\nstrength required to make these articles. Also, these\nsubstances can be given a desired shape. It means\nthat we consider the properties of substances to\nuse them for making things.\nThe same substance or material can be used\nto make many objects.

What is the difference between\nthese two groups of natural\nsubstances \u2013 leather, jute, wool,\ncotton and water, soil, metals.\nNatural substances\nSubstances available in nature\nare called natural substances. Of\nthese, the substances of the first\ngroup are obtained from living things.\nSubstances obtained from living\nthings are called biotic substances.\nAir, soil, water are substances that\nare not obtained from living things.\nThey are called abiotic substances.\n2. How are leather and wool different\nfrom jute and cotton ?\nLeather and wool are obtained\nfrom animals. They are of animal\norigin, whereas jute and cotton are\nsubstances of plant origin.\n3. Do we find plastic, nylon, brass\nor cement in nature ?\nMan-made substances\nIt is human nature to strive for\nnewer things and to try to make\nlife more comfortable. As a result\nof his efforts, man not only learnt\nto use natural substances but also\nbegan to process them to make new\nsubstances. Several such substances\nare easier to use and can be made\navailable in plenty at a low cost.\nTherefore, these substances came\nto be used on a large scale. There\nare a great many such man-made\nsubstances in use today.\nNew substances produced by\nprocessing naturally available\nsubstances are called man-made\nsubstances.\n43\nCI\nClassify.\nClassify the various substances\navailable in the house as natural\nand man-made substances.\nExamples of man-made substances\nEarlier irlis or capes made of grass\nor sackcloth were used for protection from\nrain.

To pack TV sets,\nrefrigerators, etc. big cartons and thermocol\nare being used. All these are man-made\nsubstances. These substances are water\nproof or water resistant, lightweight and\neasy to transport. That is why, they are\nbeing used increasingly.\nUse your brain power!)\nComplete the table below, showing\nhow substances of daily use are\nclassified.\nSubstances in daily use\nNatural Man-made\nArea of use\nsubstances substances\nConstruction Bamboo,\nk, cement\nstone, soil, concrete,\nwood, galvanized\ncoconut sheets, clay\nfronds, lime tiles, plastic/\nasbestos sheets\nWriting Tree bark, Pens, pencils\nmaterial leaves, made from\nbhurjpatre, plastic and\npens made metal, paper,\nfrom reeds, notebook, etc.\ndhulpatya,\nstone slates,\nstone walls\nin caves,\nsoil and\ncolours\nmade from\nplants\nThreads / Cotton, silk, | Nylon, rayon\nFibre / Yarn wool\nMan-made\nAbiotic\n| Plant origin\nLeather\nGlass can be made from sand and calcium carbonate.

This change occurs due to certain chemical reactions. These changes\nin the properties are permanent, that is, the original constituent substances cannot\nbe obtained again from the new substances. Such changes are called irreversible\nchanges.\n( 44\nProduction of substances\nRubber\nRubber is of two types, natural and\nartificial.\nNatural rubber is obtained from the\ngum or sap of trees. This sap is called\n\u2018latex\u2019 Rubber has a peculiar odour\nand it is white in colour.\nVulcanization of rubber\nIn this process, rubber is heated with\nsulphur for three to four hours. To give\nhardness to the rubber, sulphur is mixed\nin it. The proportion of sulphur in the\nmixture is determined by the purpose for\nwhich the rubber will be used.\nErasers, rubber balls, rubber toys all\nhave varying proportions of sulphur in\nthem. In rubber bands, the proportion of\nsulphur is very small.\nIn the past...\nCharles Goodyear\nspilled a mixture of\nrubber and sulphur on\na burning stove. After the\nstove was extinguished,\nhe noticed that the rubber\nhad become harder and\nless elastic. He repeated\nthis experiment in a\nsystematic way and\ninvented the process of\n\u2018vulcanization'. Hard\nand tough tyres of rubber\nmade thenceforth brought\nabout a revolutionary\nchange in transportation.\nDo you know?\nRubber is a natural substance obtained by collecting\nthe latex of a certain tree. Rubber trees are found in\nabundance in Brazil. Later, these trees were planted in\nother countries too. The botanical name of this tree is\n\u2018Hevea brasiliensis'. In India, the maximum production\nof rubber is in Kerala.\nManufacturing paper\nAdding dyes\nLogs of\nwood\nPaper\nPressing the pulp\nwith rollers\nPeeling the\nlogs\n(De-barking the\nlogs)\nPulp\nTrees\n6.2 : The process of manufacturing paper\nWinding the\npaper on reels\n( 45\nPaper\nPaper is the substance or material formed due\nto the intertwining of the cellulose fibres in grass,\nwood, rags or waste paper. Thus, paper is a kind\nof network of cellulose fibres.\nHow is paper made ?\nConiferous trees like pine are used to make\npaper. The bark of the logs of these trees is first\nremoved and the wood is broken into small pieces.\nThe mixture of these pieces and some chemicals\nis kept soaking for a long time. It helps to form\npulp. When the chemical process is completed, the\nfibrous substances from wood pulp are separated,\nand some dyes are added. The pulp is then passed\nthrough rollers, dried to form paper and finally\nwound on reels.\nPaper and wood are closely related. To save\ntrees, it is necessary to use paper sparingly.\nAlways remember...\n1. Do not tear up blank pages\nto\nof a notebook. Do not throw\naway old notebooks with\nblank pages.\n2. The blank sides of advertising\npamphlets, inner side of postal\nenvelopes, the blank sides of\nof calendars pages and other\nsuch writable surfaces can be\nused to make notes, lists, to\ncover books, etc. Do not throw\naway or burn up such paper\nuntil it has been fully utilized\nlike this.\n3. Whenever possible, try to use\na pencil and slate.\n4. Cooperate with people who\ncollect paper from garbage or\nbuy scrap paper. These people\nhelp in the proper recycling of\nresources.\nDo you know ?\n)\nIn India, the first factory to manufacture\nnewsprint (paper to be used for newspapers)\nwas established at Nepanagar in Madhya\nPradesh in 1955. Paper is also manufactured at\nSongardh in Gujarat. In Maharashtra, there is\n| a paper factory at Ballarpur near Chandrapur.\nFind out.\n1. Where was the process of\nmaking paper invented ?\n2.

From which substances in nature can we get\nthreads or fibre?\n2. What are clothes made from?\nFrom the time it was first thought that\nartificial yarn could be produced to meet the\nclothing needs of an increasing population,\nmuch research and progress has taken place\nin this field. Innumerable kinds of synthetic\nor artificial threads are now available. Nylon,\ndacron, terylene, terene, polyester, rayon are\nthe names of various synthetic threads.\nDo you know?\nSilk is a natural thread or fibre\nobtained from the\ncocoons of silk\nworms. From one\ncocoon, 500 metres to\n1300 metres of thread\ncan be obtained. It\nis said that silk was first produced\non a large scale in China.\n( 46\nAlmost all the articles made from natural fibres\nin the olden days can now be made from synthetic\nthreads.\nNylon, rayon, terylene, acrylic are all synthetic\nthreads and many articles in our daily use are made\nfrom them.\nNylon\nThese threads were invented at the same time in\nNew York and London. Therefore the initials NY of\nNew York and LON from London were combined\nto name them NYLON. Nylon threads have a shine\nand are strong, transparent and water resistant. They\nare used to manufacture clothes, fishing nets, ropes,\netc.\n.3: Artificial threads\nRayon\nCotton and wood pulp is dissolved in a\nchemical called sodium hydroxide to make\na solution. Threads are obtained from this\nsolution with the help of machines. As these\nthreads have shine and strength, they are\nsaid to be \u2018synthetic silk'. They appeared\nto be shining bright like the sun's rays.\nHence they were named \u201cRayon\u2019.\nDacron, Terylene, Terene\nVarious hydrocarbons obtained from\nmineral oils are used to make polymer\nchains. A solution of such a polymer is\npressed through a strainer with fine holes.\nThe fibres formed after cooling, are long\nand unbroken threads. These threads are\ntwisted to obtain yarn.\nDifferent types of chemicals are used\nto make threads of various properties.\nThese different threads have been named\nvariously as dacron, terylene, terene, etc.\nNew words\n1. Hydrocarbons : Substances obtained\nfrom mineral oil.\n2. Polymer chains : Long continuous\nchains formed by small, interlinked\nchemical units.\n6.4 : Uses of artificial threads\n47\nAdvantages and Shortcomings of Synthetic Fibre\nAdvantages\n1. These fibres can be manufactured\non a mass scale.\n2. They cost less.\n3. They are strong and durable.\n4. They can be used for a long time.\n5. They are water repellant, hence, do\nnot rot or get wet. They dry easily.\n6. They are lightweight and comfortable\nto wear.\n7. As they have a shine, they enhance\nthe appearance of the wearer.\n8. Clothes made from these threads are\nwrinkle-free and scratch-free.\nShortcomings\n1. They are water repellant. Hence, do\nnot absorb sweat from the skin.\n2. Continuous use of clothes made\nfrom these threads keep the skin\nmoist, which may cause skin\ndiseases.\n3. Synthetic clothes are uncomfortable\nto wear especially in summer.\n4. Synthetic fabric catches fire easily.\n5. If they catch fire, the cloth sticks to\nthe skin and causes serious injuries.\n6. These fibres are not decomposed by\nmicro-organisms.\nWAVE Always remember...\nWhat we have learnt-\nSave trees to save nature; save paper\nto save trees. Use paper properly\nand economically. Make full use of\nit and recycle the used paper.\nAlthough there are some\ndisadvantages in using synthetic\nfibres, they can be useful if they\nare used in the proper way. They\nreduce the load on the use of natural\nresources.\nWe use two types of materials \u2013\nnatural and man-made. Natural\nmaterials may be biotic or abiotic.\nBiotic materials are either of plant\norigin or animal origin.\nRubber, paper and synthetic fibres\nare important man-made materials\nin our daily use.\nMan-made materials are obtained\nby using certain processes.\nScience watch ...\nWhile studying science, we do verify whatever we learn, but what about\nothers ?

Name the\nones you see in the pictures. Which main constituents of\nfood do we get from them ?\n7.1 : Foodstuffs\nLiving things take food and water and use them for\na variety of purposes such as :\n\u2022 Obtaining energy \u2022 Growth of the body\n\u2022 To carry out day to day functions of the body\n. To fight diseases\nNutrients and foodstuffs\nThere are six main nutrients in our food:Carbohydrates,\nfats, proteins, fibre, vitamins and minerals. These nutrients\nare present in the different food items we eat in differing\nproportions. Let us learn more about some of them.\nEnergy-giving nutrients \u2013 Carbohydrates\nOur main need is of energy. It is fulfilled\nby carbohydrates. Hence, our diet includes\na large proportion of cereals in the form of\nrice, chapatti or roti, bhakri and bread which\ncontain carbohydrates. Cereals are our staple\nfood.\nIn living things, the\nprocess of taking in\nfood and water and\nusing it for growth\nand other purposes is\ncalled 'nutrition, and\nthe constituents of food\nuseful for these purposes\nare called 'nutrients\".\n7.2: Cereals\nFats\nSome part of our energy requirement is also\nfulfilled by fatty foods such as oil, ghee and butter.\nWe get energy in the form of heat from the food\nwe eat. Heat is measured in kilocalories. Hence, the\nenergy in food items is also measured in kilocalories\n(Calories).\nChildren of growing age need to get approximately\n2000 to 2500 Calories from the food they eat.\n7.3 : Fatty foods\n(50)\nProteins\nWe need proteins for the\npurposes of growth, repairing\nthe wear and tear of the body\nand for other life processes. We\nget proteins from the sprouts,\nmilk and milk products, meat\nand eggs in our food.\nMinerals and vitamins\n7.4 : Proteins\nTo improve the body's resistance to disease and for other life processes the body\nneeds vitamins, minerals and fibre in the diet. We obtain these nutrients mainly from\nvegetables and fruits.\nWe require vitamins and minerals in small quantities, but their deficiency can lead\nto various diseases. Let us learn more about them.\nThe body needs several inorganic substances. They are called minerals. The table\nbelow gives examples of some minerals and provides information about their functions\nin the body, the various sources of the minerals as well as the diseases caused by\ntheir deficiency.\nMineral\nFunctions\nSources Deficiency Diseases\nIron\nCarrying oxygen to all Meat, spinach,\nparts of the body.\napples, raisins\nCalcium and Strengthen bones and teeth.

For example, Vitamin C is easily\ndestroyed during cooking. Therefore, Vitamin C rich foods should be eaten raw.\n(52\nScurvy\nIn the past.....\nCasimir Funk was a\nscientist who belonged to\nPoland in Europe. In a\nscientific article, he read\nthat people who ate brown\nrice were less likely to get\nberiberi than those who ate\nfully milled rice.\nHe was able to identify\nand isolate the substance\nwhich prevents this disease.\nHe named it \u2018vitamine'.\nHe also proposed that\nother disorders like scurvy,\npellagra and rickets were\nalso caused by a deficiency\nof various vitamins.\nProbiotics\nYou know that the useful\nmicro-organisms which convert\nmilk into yoghurt are present in\nyoghurt and in buttermilk. They\nare called 'probiotics\u2019. Lakhs of\nmicro-organisms reside in our\nintestines. Their presence in such\nlarge numbers is essential for our\nhealth. Hence to maintain them\nin our body, we should include\nprobiotics such as yoghurt and\nbuttermilk in our daily diet.\nWhen we suffer from loose\nmotions and vomiting, we throw\nout micro-organisms along with\nintestinal water. Some medicines\ncan also kill them. Therefore, we\nneed to take extra yoghurt/\nbuttermilk to restore their\nnumbers.\nRickets\nGoitre\nA balanced diet\nAll that we consume during the\nday is together called our \u201cdiet'. A\ndiet containing adequate quantities\nof all nutrients is called a Balanced\nDiet.\nFatty substances\n(oil, ghee, butter)\nMilk products, meat,\nfish, eggs\nTo build a strong and healthy\nbody, you need all nutrients in the\nright proportion and in sufficient\nquantities in your daily diet.\nSignificance of a balanced diet:\nFruits and\nvegetables\nCereals\nand\npulses\n\u2022 An increased capacity to work.\n\u2022 Good physical and mental health.\n\u2022 Increased capacity to fight/resist\ndiseases.\n\u2022 Helps in proper growth of the body.\n7.6 : The balanced diet pyramid\nApart from having a balanced diet,\nwe also need to exercise regularly to\nkeep ourselves fit and healthy.\n53\n8\nAlways remember...\nHow to get a balanced diet ?\nTo ensure that we get a balanced diet from\nthe food we eat, we can make a food pyramid.\nAll food which we eat is classified into various\ngroups. The space allotted to each food group in\nthe pyramid, depends upon the proportion in which\nit should be included in our diet. Hence, we can\nchoose foods from each group daily according to\nthe space allotted to it in the pyramid.\nIf we choose some items from each group in the\nright proportion according to the pyramid shown on\npage 53, we can make sure that we are getting a\nbalanced diet.\nFibre\nIf we select a daily diet which includes\nvegetables, fruits, sprouts and cereals according\nto the pyramid, we will also get fibre in sufficient\nquantity.\nIf our need for nutrients\nis met through the food\nwe eat, the nutrients\nare better utilised in\nour body. Hence, the\nbest way to good health\nis taking a balanced\ndiet and avoiding\nthe deficiency of any\nnutrient.\nCan you recall ?\nWhat trouble do we have to face if we do not get\nenough fibre from our daily diet ?\nWhat care must be taken to make sure that fibre\nis not lost or removed from the food we eat?\nWater\nAlongwith all the other nutrients, the body\nalso needs an adequate supply of water. For this\npurpose, we must drink milk, buttermilk, lemon\njuice, sherbets, fruit juices and plenty of water.\nMalnutrition\nMalnutrition occurs when all the nutrients\nthat the body needs are not obtained in the proper\nproportions from the diet. This happens when a\nperson does not get sufficient food or when the\ndiet is not balanced. If one's diet exceeds one's\nneed, it is called overnutrition.\nUse your brain power!\nChoose a balanced diet for one day\naccording to your preferences.\n7.7 : Malnutrition and overnutrition\n( 54\nHow to avoid obesity ?\nHave a balanced diet.\n\u2022 Eat whole grains. Eat fruits\nand vegetables with their\nskins.\n\u2022 Increase use of bicycles\n\u2022 Play more outdoor games\nJunk food\nChocolates, noodles, burgers, pizzas, chips,\nbottled soft drinks, attractively packaged snacks\nas also ready fried foodstuffs available in the\nmarket such as wadas, pakodas, etc. are very\ntasty and we like them very much. However,\nthese foodstuffs contain refined flour, sugar,\noil in large proportions. When refined flour,\nis made from wheat or when sugar is made\nfrom sugarcane, many nutrients in the wheat\nor sugarcane are lost in the process. Hence,\nall we get from these foods is energy and our\nhunger is satisfied.\nNaturally, if we eat a lot of junk foods,\nwe will get insufficient quantities of the\nitems from other food groups. If this happens\nfrequently, our body soon experiences a\nshortage of proteins, vitamins and minerals\nand that may lead to malnutrition.\nJunk food eaten frequently also causes\nobesity. Obesity is not good for our health.\nAs such foods do not supply all the\nnecessary nutrients, they are called junk foods.\n\u2022 Do not eat if you are not\nhungry.\n\u2022 Do not watch TV while\neating.\n\u2022 Do not use motor vehicles for\ntravelling a short distance.\n\u2022 Avoid precooked, packaged\nfoods.\nFood Items\nAdulterants\nAdulteration of food\nIn order to earn more profits, cheaper\nsubstances of low quality are mixed with\nthe foodstuffs. These substances are called\nadulterants and adding them to foodstuffs\nis called adulteration of food. Adulterants\nmay even be poisonous or harmful to\nhealth. Such adulterated food is impure\nand harmful and so unfit for consumption.\nAdulterants\nAdulterants used to adulterate food are\nsuch that they will remain unnoticed even\nwhen mixed with the food.\n\u2022 Milk Water, chemicals like\nurea, starch\n\u2022 Chilli\nBrick powder,\npowder powdered pumpkin\n\u2022 Pepper corns Papaya seeds\n\u2022 Ice-cream Washing soda,\npaper pulp\n\u2022 Rice Small white stones\n\u2022 Peanuts Reddish pebbles/stones\nAlways remember....\nAdulteration of food is a crime.

This is\ncalled a \u201cfracture of the bone.\nA fracture in a bone causes severe\nand unbearable pain and the part with the\nbroken bone swells immediately.\nCan you tell ?\nYour friend meets with an accident and\na bone in his leg is fractured. How will\n8.2: A boy with a fractured bone\nyou help?\nAfter an accident, prevent any movement of the fractured part. Immobilize it and\nget immediate medical help. After going to the hospital, an X-ray\u2019 image is taken of\nthe part which is swollen.\nX-rays' were discovered by Wilhelm Conrad Roentgen.\n(57)\nPlaster\nA fractured\nbone\n8.3 : An X-ray image\nAn X-ray image shows whether a bone is broken\nand also the exact spot where it is broken. This helps in\nproviding the proper treatment.\nLet's try this.\nTypes of Bones : Bones of our body\nare classified into four types.\n1. Flat bones\nLet's identify our bones.\n(1) Place your hand at the centre of\nyour chest and your friend's back.\n(2) What is the name of the hard part\nyou feel on placing your hand on\nyour chest ?\n(3) Do you feel some hard bumps on\nthe back? What are they called ?\n(4) What difference do you notice\nbetween the bones of the back and\nthose of the chest ?\n2. Small bones\n3. Irregular bones\nThe human skeletal system\nAll the bones in our body are not of\nthe same shape. Every bone is different.\nAll the bones together form a framework\nor skeleton. The skeleton gives a shape\nto the body.\nAll the bones of the body along\nwith cartilage together form the skeletal\nsystem.\nBones are hard. They are not flexible.\nBones are composed of two main\nconstituents. Bone cells are biotic, while\ncalcium carbonate, calcium phosphate,\nminerals and salts are the abiotic\nconstituents of bones. Calcium imparts\nstrength to the bones.\n4. Long bones\nThe system which gives a definite shape to the body, provides support and\nprotects the delicate organs inside the body is the skeletal system.\n( 58\nCan you tell ?\nCan you identify the animals from\nskeletons ?\nthe pictures of their\n8.4 : Skeletons of various animals\nSkull\nTry this.\nTake a measuring tape and measure the\nlength of the bones of your arms and\nlegs.

Arm\nbones\n2. Leg\nbones\nThe human skeletal system can be\ndivided into two parts : the axial skeleton\nand the appendicular skeleton.\nThe axial skeleton consists of the\nskull, the spine and the rib cage. These\nare situated symmetrically along the\ncentral vertical axis of the body.\nThe appendicular skeleton is made\nup of the bones of the upper and lower\nlimbs (arms and legs) on either side of\nthe central axis.\n+\nLeg\n8.5 : Parts of the human skeletal system\n( 59\nAs our body grows, the size and length of our bones increases. Such changes\nin size and length can be seen in children according to age. However, the body\ncontinues to grow only up to a certain limit. The bones of taller people are longer.\nThe axial skeleton\nSkull : The skull is formed by the bones of the head\nand face. The bones of the skull are flat and strong. There\nSkull/\nare altogether 22 bones in the skull, 8 in the head and 14\nCranium\nin the face. Except for the lower jaw, none of the bones\nof the skull can move.\nLower jaw/\nMandible\nWhich organs of our body does the skull protect ?\nRib cage : Feel the left and right sides of your chest\nRib cage\nwith your hand or finger. How many bones can you feel\naltogether on the two sides ?\nCheck in the centre. How many bones do you feel ?\nThe cage-like structure in the chest is calld the rib\ncage. In the chest, there is one vertical, flat bone called\nthe sternum. Twelve pairs of flat bones called ribs are\njoined to it sideways. These 25 bones form the rib cage.\nIt is joined to the spine at the back.\nThe Spine (Backbone or Vertebral Column) : The\nspine is formed by padlock-shaped bones placed straight\none above the other. There are altogether 33 bones in the\nspine, each called a vertebra. These bones are arranged\none above the other flexibly. The spine protects the spinal\ncord that originates from the brain.\nBack bone/\nVertebral\nWhat would have happened if we didn't have a\ncolumn\nbackbone ?\nVertebrae\nThe appendicular skeleton\nThe human body has two arms and two legs. The\ndifferent parts of the arms and legs have several bones,\nwhich are connected together by joints.\n8.6 : Skull, rib cage and spinal column\nDo you know?\nThere are three bones in each of the ears.\nOf these, the stirrup is the smallest bone in our\nbody. It is as small as a grain of rice and is\nhollow. Its shape is like that of a stirrup.\nIn the human body, the longest and strongest\nbone is the thigh bone or the femur.\nStirrup\n(60)\nObserve and discuss.\nObserve a human skeleton in your school laboratory or a picture of the skeleton\nand classify the bones in our body into four types. Discuss the functions of these bones.\nTry this.\nMove the different parts of your body\nfrom the head to the toes and observe the\ndifferent places at which they can bend\nor turn.\nThe bones in our body are connected to\neach other by means of ligaments.\nJoints : Joints are the places\nwhere two or more than\ntwo bones are connected to each\nother. Joints are of two types.\nJoints\nMovable Joint\nBones can move.\nExamples : bones\nof arms and legs\nImmovable Joint\nBones cannot move.\nExample : bones of\nthe skull.\n(Other than the lower\njaw)\nHinge joint\nTypes of joints\nLet us study some types of movable\njoints.\n1. Hinge joint : This type of joint\nallows the movements of bones only in\none direction. It moves in a 180\u00b0 angle.\nExamples : the elbow and knee joints.\nBall and\nsocket\njoint\nGliding\njoint\n2. Ball and socket joint : In this\ntype of joint, the bones can move in two\nor more directions \u2013 in a 360\u00b0 angle.\nExamples : shoulder and hip joints.\n3. Gliding joint : In this type of\njoint, the bones can only slide over each\nother. Examples : wrist and ankle joints.\n8.7 : Some types of joints\n61\nCan you recall ?\nWhich organ helps us to sense whether\nsomething is hot or cold, rough or\nsmooth, etc. ?\nThe skin\nThe skin is an important and large\norgan of all living things. The skin has\nhair. There are nails on the skin at the\ntips of the fingers and toes. The skin\ngives us the sense of touch. The skin is\nan important sensory organ of the body.\nFunctions of the skin\n1. Protecting the internal parts of the\nbody like muscles, bones,\norgan systems, etc.\n2. Help preserve the moisture\nin the body.\n3. Synthesizing vitamin \u2018D'.\n4. Releasing sweat to regulate\nbody temperature.\n5. Giving protection from\nthe heat and cold.\n6. The skin functions as\nthe sensory organ of touch.\nEpidermis\nDermis\nThe outermost covering of the\nbody is called skin.\nThe structure of the skin\nHuman skin is made up of two main\nlayers. The outermost layer is called the\nepidermis and the layer below it is called\nthe dermis. Below the dermis, there is a\nnetwork of blood vessels and nerve fibres.\nThe subcutaneous layer under this network\nmaintains normal body temperature. The\nepidermis has various layers.\nSubcutis\n(Hypodermis)\n8.8 : Structure of the skin\nCan you tell ?\nMelanin\nA pigment called melanin is present\nin the cells of the epidermis. The\nmelanin is synthesized in certain\nglands in the skin. The percentage\nof melanin decides the fairness or\ndarkness of the skin. The colour of\nthe skin also depends on the climate.\nMelanin protects our skin and the\ninner parts from ultraviolet sunrays.\nWhat happens when we walk or play in\nthe hot sun ?\nWhen we walk or play in the sun, we\nget tired, but at the same time our skin\nbecomes wet. This is because of sweat.\nIn the skin, there are glands which secrete\nsweat. They are called sweat glands.\nAfter playing in the hot sun or after\nhard physical labour, the temperature of\nthe body rises. Then sweat is released.\nIt helps to reduce the temperature of\nthe body. Our body temperature usually\nremains constant at approximately 37\u00b0C.\nUse your brain power!\n1.

How does sweating help to lower\nthe temperature of the body ?\n( 62\nObserve and discuss.\nObserve your skin and the skin of your\ngrandmother, grandfather or any old\npeople in the house.\nWhat difference do you notice ?\nAs we grow older, the proportion of\nfat beneath the skin reduces. However,\nthe previously taut skin does not shrink.\nThis causes wrinkles on the skin of older\npeople.\nDo you know?\nIt is melanin that determines the\ncolour of our hair, too. Jet black hair\nis due to pure melanin, while brown,\nlighter hair is due to sulphur in the\nmelanin and reddish hair, due to iron\nin the melanin.\ny Always remember...\nFor the health of our skin, it is\nimportant to keep it clean.\nDiscriminating between people\nbased on their skin colour is\nunscientific and wrong. Avoid the\ntemptation of using artificial means\nto become fair.\nWhat we have learnt-\nAll the bones in the body along with the cartilage together form the\nskeletal system.\nThe skeleton gives shape and support to the body.\n\u2022 The outer covering of the body is called the skin.\n\u2022 The skeletal system and the skin perform the important function of\nprotecting the body and the internal body parts.\n\u2022 We must take care of our skeletal system and skin.\nThe skull, the rib cage, the backbone and the bones of the arms and\nlegs are the main parts of the human skeletal system.\n\u2022 Epidermis and dermis are the two main layers of the human skin.\n63\nExercise\n1.

Moving objects are said to\nbe objects in motion. Discuss which objects in the above pictures are in motion. What\ndifferences are seen in their motion ?\nMotion\nWhile waiting for a bus at a bus-stop, other\nvehicles appear to be in a state of motion. On the\nother hand, when you are in motion yourself, a\nstill object appears to be moving. For example,\nthe trees are seen to run backward while you\nare travelling in a train. If an object is seen by\nan observer to change its place continuously,\nthe object is said to be in motion. Change\nof place of an object is called displacement.\n9.2 : Backward motion of object\nAn object in motion continuously undergoes\ndisplacement.\nThe continuous displacement of an object is called motion.\nTypes of\nmotion\n1. Linear motion\n9.3 : Linear motion\nA train or a moving vehicle on a road may travel in a straight line or\nin the same direction. This motion of an object is called linear motion. An\nobject in linear motion shows displacement along a straight line.\nIf you stand on a chair and release a ball from your hand, it falls to\nthe floor.

Non-linear motion may be of the following types.\nWhat kind of movement does a swing in a\nCan you tell ?\npark show ?\nThe swing always comes back from\none end to the other end. It takes about the\nsame time for each swing or oscillation.\nThis movement of a swing is called\noscillatory motion. Similarly, the\nmovement of the pendulum of a clock, the\nwings of a bird, the needle of a sewing\nmachine, the vibrating diaphragm of a\ntabla or drum are also examples of\noscillatory motion.\n9.5 : Oscillatory motion\n66\nThe motion of a body that is oscillating, i.e.,\nswinging back and forth, is called\noscillatory motion.\nUse your brain power!\nIn which musical instruments can\nyou see oscillatory motion ?\nObserve and discuss.\n9.6 : Examples of non-linear motion\nThe motion of an object along a\ncircular path is called circular motion.\nThe motion of an object which passes\nthrough a certain point again and\nagain after a fixed period is called\nperiodic motion.\nUse your brain power!\nThe hands of a clock move in a\ncircular manner. Similarly, a fan, a giant\nwheel, and a merry-go-round complete\neach round along a circular route. In our\nday-to-day life we come across many\nexamples of objects that trace a circular\npath.\nWhich other examples of circular\nmotion can you give ?\nWe see from these examples of\noscillatory motion and circular motion\nthat some objects complete one round\nor one oscillation in a fixed period of\ntime. For example, the minute hand of\na clock completes one round in exactly\n60 minutes every time, while a merry-\ngo-round also completes every round in\nthe same period of time. Such motion is\ncalled periodic motion.\nWhich types of motion are seen when\na girl rides a bicycle as shown here ?\n67.\nDon\n9.7 : Children playing in a garden\nOye Can you tell ?\nWhile chasing a butterfly in a garden, do you run along a\ndefinite path or in the same direction all the time ?

How does its direction\nchange?\n4. Will the wheel go forward if it is not pushed with a stick ?\nWhen we kick the football coming in our direction, towards the goal, we apply force. In\nday-to-day life, we do many actions such as lifting, pulling, riding a bicycle and stopping\nit at times, pushing a load, squeezing or bending something and driving vehicles. It is\nnecessary to apply force for doing all these actions. Force is applied to an object to pull it\nor push it in any manner.\nNo object changes its position on its own.

The earth's gravitational force acts in a direction\nopposite to that of an object moving upwards. Hence, the speed\nof that object goes on decreasing till in the end it becomes\nzero. Then the object starts falling down instead of going up\nany further. While falling, its speed goes on increasing all the\ntime due to gravitational force.\n71\n10.6 : Dropping a stone in water\nFYLet's try this.\n1. Take a small stone and a bucketful of water.\nDrop the stone into the water from a height of\nabout 20 cm. You will hear the sound of the stone\ndropping in the water.

What do you notice ?\nThe smooth surfaces can be easily rubbed against each\nother because the force of friction between them is less,\nwhile rough surfaces cannot be easily rubbed against each\nother because the force of friction between them is much\ngreater.\nIt is possible for us to walk on the ground only because\nof the force of friction. If there is no friction, we would\nslip and fall. For example, we are very likely to slip while\nwalking on an oily or wet floor.\nWhy is a wooden plank laid down for pulling out a car\nwhich is stuck in mud?\n| A force of friction is generated between the wheel and\nthe wooden plank laid down under the car. Hence, it can be\npulled out from the mud. In short, the force of friction can\neither be decreased or increased as desired.\n6. Electrostatic force\n1. Spread small pieces of paper on a table.

What actions are seen in the picture ?\n2. Is a force being applied while doing each\naction ?\n3. In the various actions in the picture, has\nthe object changed its original position ?\n11.1 : Various actions\nIn the above picture, we see that the position of some of the objects has changed.\nThat is, these objects are displaced.\nWhen an object is displaced by applying a force on it, work is said to be done.\nWork\n1.

Hold the other end of the string and pull it\ndownwards to lift the load, first up to a height of\none metre, and then up to a height of four metres.\nWhen is more work done ?\n4m\n2m\nWhen the applied force is the same,\nmore work is done when there is greater\ndisplacement. In other words, for\nmeasuring the work, both the force and the\ndisplacement must be considered.\n11.3 : Using a pulley\nThe relationship between work and energy\nThe boy in the picture has applied a force to\nthe toy car. Work has been done because the force\napplied to the car has caused displacement. In other\nwords, transformation of the boy's energy into work\nhas taken place through the applied force.\nRun around the ground with your friends.

The capacity to do work is called energy.\nUse your brain power!)\nDo you know?\n1. Why do you get hungry after\nphysical exercise ?\n2. From where does our body get\nenergy?\n3. Why do we get tired ?\nThe units of work and energy are\nthe same. Work and energy are both\nmeasured in the unit named Joule in\nS.I. (System International) units.\nForms of energy\nA. Mechanical energy\nCan you tell ?\nWhat will happen as a result of the\naction in the picture ?\n1. The rubber band is released after stretching it.\n2. A stone is held in the rubber of a catapult, the\nrubber is stretched and released.\nIn the above examples we see that when the\nrubber of a catapult is stretched and released, it\ncomes back to the original state and the stone flies\noff. Similarly, when the spring of a toy is wound\nand then released, the toy starts playing. When\nwater stored at a height is made to fall on a wheel,\nthe wheel starts rotating. In each of these actions,\ndisplacement takes place, which means that work is\ndone. From where is the energy obtained to do this\nwork? The energy which is stored in an object due\nto a specific state or position of that object is called\npotential energy.\n11.5: Potential energy\n-\nLet's try this.\n1. Take two balls. Let one of them stand\nstable at the centre of a table.\n2. Place the second ball on the table and\npush it so that it hits the first ball.\n3. What happens when the second ball hits\nthe first one ?\n4. From where did the second ball get the\nenergy to set the first ball in motion ?\n11.6 : Kinetic energy\nCan you tell?\n1. In the game of marbles, from where does one marble\nget energy to set another marble in motion ?\n2. While playing carrom, from where does the striker\nget the energy to make the pieces move ?\nWe give energy to the marble or the striker and set\nthem in motion. The energy obtained from motion is\ncalled kinetic energy.\nThe energy used for\ndoing mechanical work\nis called mechanical\nenergy. There are two\ntypes of mechanical\nenergy, namely,\npotential energy and\nkinetic energy. Potential\nenergy is obtained due\nto position and kinetic\nenergy, by motion.\n( 78\nB. Heat energy\nThe earth receives heat in proper quantities from\nthe sun. That is how an atmospheric temperature\nfavourable to the living world is maintained. Heat is a\nform of energy. Sunlight contains heat energy.\nHeat is produced by burning of fuel. Heat energy\nis used in the kitchen all the time. Heat is measured in\nthe unit \u2018Calorie\u2019.\n- Let's try this.\n1. Take a convex lens and hold it over a sheet of\npaper in sunlight.\n2. Now, move the lens in such a way that there is a\ntiny spot of light on the paper.\n3. Hold the lens in this position for a while. What\n11.7 : Heat energy\nhappens ?\nC. Light energy\nCollect information.\nWe have learnt that plants\nmake their own food with the\nhelp of sunlight. It means that\n1. Generally, grapes which appear in the\nlight energy is transformed into\nmarket during December and January are\nthe energy in food. Plants and\nsour. However, in March-April the grapes\nanimals use this food for doing\nare sweet. Why is this so?\ntheir work. It means that light is a 2. How does a picture appear on the screen of\nform of energy.\na TV, mobile, laptop and a cinema theatre ?\nD. Sound energy\nYou might have seen the glass panes of windows crack due to a loud noise.\nSimilarly, sound is used to control the movements of some toy cars. This means that\nsome work is done by sound. It tells us that sound is a form of energy\nE. Chemical energy\nWhen wood burns, we get\nheat and light. Sometimes, we\nhear a crackling sound as well.\nWhat makes this happen ? The\nenergy stored in wood is emitted\nin various forms through chemical\naction. Also, it is due to the\nchemical action in the lead acid\nbattery that electrical energy is\n11. 8 : Chemical energy\nproduced\nThe energy obtained through chemical action is called chemical energy.\nUse your brain power!)\n1. In which form is energy stored in plant food ?\n2. How is energy obtained from cooking gas ?\nMechanical energy, heat,\nlight, sound, chemical and\nelectrical energy are the\nvarious forms of energy.\nObserve and discuss.\nObserve the working of the various appliances\nwe use such as the fan, lamp, mixer, TV, radio,\nrefrigerator, washing machine, clothes iron. In which\nform is energy supplied to them to make them work?\n11.9 : Transformation of energy\nTransformation of energy\nTransformation of energy takes place when work is done. Let us consider one\nchain of transformation of energy.\nIn the course of the water cycle, water evaporates due to the heat of the\nsun. This water vapour forms clouds that give rain. Rainwater flows into rivers\nand is stored in reservoirs on dams. These are at a height and therefore their\nwater has potential energy, which is transformed into kinetic energy as the water\nfalls downwards. When the water falls on the blades of turbine, its kinetic energy\nis transferred to the turbine. The turbine rotates producing electrical energy. This\nelectricity gets transformed into various other forms of energy.\nElectrical energy is used in our houses for various purposes. It is transformed\ninto light energy on lighting a bulb, into kinetic energy on starting a fan, into sound\nenergy while playing a music system, and into heat energy in an oven.\nThus we see that we are indirectly utilizing nothing but solar energy in all\nthese transformations of energy. In other words, the sun is the most important\nsource of all energy.\n( 80\nEnergy resources\nThe resources used for getting energy can be\nclassified into two types.\n1. Conventional energy resources or\nnon-renewable energy resources.\nThe energy resources which man has been using\nfor centuries are called conventional energy sources.\nConventional energy resources include coal and\nfossil fuels such as petrol, diesel and natural gas. We\ncannot replenish these resources. Wood also cannot\nbe replenished easily.\n2. Non-conventional energy resources or\nrenewable energy resources\nThese resources have not been used traditionally.\nThey are inexhaustible and continuous and can be\nused in various forms again and again.\nDue to the increasing\npopulation and\nincreasing usage of\nenergy resources, there\nis a danger that the\nlimited reserves of\ncoal, petrol, diesel,\ncrude oil and natural\ngas will get exhausted.\nTherefore, it will be\nbetter to use alternative\nand supplementary\nresources instead of the\nconventional ones.\nA. Solar energy: The energy\nobtained from the sun is continuous and\nenormous. Solar energy is at the root\nof all energy available on the earth. A\nvariety of devices have been developed\nfor making use of solar energy. For\nexample, the solar cooker, solar water\nheater, solar drier, solar cell, etc.\nIn the first three devices mentioned\nabove, heat energy obtained from the sun\nis utilized to cook food, heat water and\nto dry grain. In a solar cell, electrical\nenergy can be obtained from solar energy.\nSolar electric plants have the capacity to\nproduce electricity on a large scale. A\nsolar plant consists of many solar cells.\nB. Wind energy : Electricity is\ngenerated by means of windmills using\nstrong winds. A windmill is also used for\ndrawing water from a well.\n11.10 : Solar energy\n11.11 : Wind energy\nC. Tidal energy : A wall is constructed at a narrow region of a creek. Due to\nwaves generated by high and low tides, the turbine of the generator fitted in the wall\nstarts rotating and electricity is generated.\n81\nD. Hydroelectric or hydel power :\nThe water stored in a dam at a height\nis brought down through a tunnel and\nthe turbines of the generator are rotated.\nThe place where electricity is generated\nin this way is called a 'hydroelectric or\nhydel power' plant. The Koyna project\nin Maharashtra is a well-known hydel\nproject. There are also other smaller\nhydroelectric plants located at other dam\nsites.\n11.12 : Hydel power\nE. Energy obtained from oceanic\nwaves : While sea waves move forward in\na certain direction, the water moves up and\nUse your brain power!)\ndown regularly at a position. This, too, can\nbe used to generate electricity.\nThere is energy in every substance\nF. Atomic energy : The serious\nin the universe. It is present in\ncrisis of electricity shortage can be eased\nnon-living things as well as in\nby generating electricity by means of\nliving things. Why, then is energy\natomic energy. The heat liberated during\nnot visible to us ?\nthe fission of atoms of heavy elements\nsuch as uranium, thorium is used to\ngenerate electricity.\nThink over it!\nNote the amounts of your electricity bills of the last eight months and think about\nthe consumption of electricity during each month.\nWhat we have learnt-\nEnergy saving and green energy\nIn a way, saving energy is as good as\ngenerating energy. There are several\nways of saving energy such as putting\noff lamps when not needed, making\nmaximum use of sunlight, etc. Saving\nenergy and energy resources is very\nnecessary. Otherwise, we will have\nto face a serious calamity like global\nwarming\nThe energy resources which do not\nproduce smoke and carbon gases such\nas carbon dioxide or carbon monoxide\nare called \u201cGreen energy resources'.\nGreater use of such resources is the\nneed of the hour.\nWork is done when an object\nundergoes displacement on\napplication of a force.\nEnergy is the capacity to do work.\n\u2022 The various forms of energy are\nmechanical energy, heat energy,\nlight energy, sound energy, chemical\nenergy and electrical energy.\n\u2022 Something that can be used to obtain\nenergy is called an energy resource.\nEnergy resources are of two kinds:\nconventional (non-renewable) and\nnon-conventional (renewable) energy\nresources.\n( 82\nExercise\n1.

They have only one\nor two parts and a simple and\neasy structure. Such machines are\ncalled simple machines. Simple\nmachines can be handled easily,\nand there are less chances of\nthese machines breaking down\nor getting damaged. We use many\nsuch machines in our day-to-day\nlife.\n12.1: Various kinds of tasks\nObserve the machines shown in the following pictures. For what\nCan you tell ? purposes are they used ? Can you name some other machines\nof this kind?\nThese machines have\nmany parts which carry out\nmany processes for completing\na task. For this purpose, the\nparts are joined to one another.\nTherefore, these machines are\ncalled complex machines.\nSome of the parts of such\ncomplex machines are actually\nsimple machines. The structure\nof complex machines is\ncomplicated.\n12.2 : Various machines\nIn our day-to-day life, we use simple or complex machines depending upon the task\nto be carried out and the time and efforts required to do it.\n(84)\nLet us learn about some simple machines.\nAn inclined plane\nA heavy drum is to be loaded onto a truck.\nRavi chose the plank A while Hamid chose the\nplank B. Rahi did not use a plank at all.\n1. Who would find the drum heaviest to load ?\n2. Who would find it lightest ?\nWhich one of the planks A and B is longer ?\nWhich one has a steeper slope ?\nWhat can we conclude from this ?\nIf a slanting plank is used to lift a weight, we\nhave to bear less of the weight and lifting it becomes\neasier. Such a plank is called an \u201cinclined plane\u2019.\nThe more gradual the slope, the lesser is the weight\nwe bear. But, such an inclined plane is longer. The\nsteeper the slope, the shorter the inclined plane. But\nwe have to bear a greater weight.\n12.3 : Loading a drum onto a truck\nLet's try this.\n000000000\nCut out a triangular piece of paper ABC.\nDraw a red line along the edge AC. Roll\nthis paper around a pencil as shown in the\npicture. What do you see?\nThe inclined side AC of the triangle\ndescends gradually from A to C.\nThe threads on a screw are made in\nthe same way. That is why, when a screw\nis fitted in wood it goes in as if it is going\ndown an inclined plane. Therefore, less force\nis required to fit a screw than to hammer a\nnail. In other words, a screw is like a rolled\nup inclined plane made of an iron strip.\nA winding road or ghat that goes up\na mountain is also like an inclined plane\nwrapped around the mountain. It helps big\nvehicles to climb up and down the mountain\neasily.\n12.4 : The screw as an inclined plane\nObserve and discuss.\nVaraddha Ghat\nSuresh Bave, Pune\n29.Jun 2015\nTwo routes, namely, a pathway and a\nroad are available to climb the mountain\nshown in the picture.

That is why, it is called the\nArchimedes' Screw. It was used to\nlift water from the hold of a ship.\nArchimedes used a round pipe fitted\nwith a rod inside it. The pipe was\nplaced at an angle of 45\u00b0 with one end\ninside the water and the rod resting\non a flat surface. When the rod was\nturned, water got lifted in this device.\nArchimedes' screw\nA wedge\nAn axe is used for cutting wood. A sharp tool is\nformed on joining two inclined planes. Such a tool is\ncalled a wedge. A wedge in used for breaking an object\ninto two pieces or to seperate objects stuck together.\nAn axe, a knife or a chisel are some examples of this\nsimple machine.\nA needle and a nail are also kinds of wedges.\n12.6 : Wedges\nUse your brain power!)\nD A needle is required for stitching cloth. We use a\nknife for cutting fruit. If the tip of a needle or the\nedge of a knife becomes blunt, then the needle does not penetrate the cloth and the\nknife does not cut into the fruit. Why is this so?\nA lever\nA farmer is using a strong crow-bar to remove\nthe big stone bogged down in the farm. Such a\nmachine is called a lever.\nA lever has three parts, namely, effort, load\nand fulcrum.\n1. The support at which the rod of a lever is 12.7 : Remov arge stone\nrested is called the \u2018fulcrum of a lever'. The\nlever rotates about the fulcrum.\n2. The weight lifted by a lever or the force\nUse your brain power!\nagainst which the lever acts is called the\n\u2018load'. The arm of the lever from the\nWhich tasks can be done using\nfulcrum to the load is called the \u2018load arm\u2019.\na lever?\n3. The force applied on the other end of the rod to lift the load is called the\n\u2018effort'. The part of the lever from the fulcrum to the effort is called the effort\narm'.\n(86\nFYLet's try this.\n1. Place a pencil on a table. Place a ruler on it at right angles\nwith it. Put a paperweight on one end of the ruler. Press the\nother end with your finger to lift the weight.

Such a\nFulcrum\nlever is called a lever of the first order.\n2. The picture shows how we use an opener to remove\nthe cap of a sauce bottle. Try to do the same yourself.\nTo remove the tight-fitting cap, the opener is rested\non the cap and we apply a force on the opposite end\nof the opener to pull it upwards. The cap also gets\npulled up as the opener rotates about the fulcrum.\nWhere are the fulcrum, load and effort in this case ?\n12.9 : Removing the lid\n3. How do we lift an object using tongs ?\nThe weight or the load is at one end of the arms\nFulcrum Effort\nof the tongs. We apply effort in the middle of the\narms.

This is convenient and easy. You must have seen some\nexamples of pulleys in day-to-day use. Make a list of these.\nCan you tell ?\nA wheel and axle\n1. All of you must have enjoyed sitting on a giant\nwheel. What makes the giant wheel go round?\nThe giant wheel is fitted to a rod at its centre. This\nrod is called an \u201caxle\u2019. When the axle starts rotating\nwith the help of electricity, the wheel fitted to it also\nstarts rotating. This combination of an axle and a wheel\nis a simple machine. We see innumerable examples of\nits use.\n2. When the pedal of a bicycle is rotated, the wheel\nstarts rotating. How does this happen?\n12.12 : A giant wheel\n88\nMaintenance of machines\nParts of machines rub against one another\nwhen they are used. Soiled, dusty parts create\nmore friction. Some parts, affected by the\nweather, rust and erode. Machines get damaged,\nor become useless due to such wear and tear. To\navoid this, it is very important to take care of\nmachines.\nDuring the maintenance of a machine, all its\nparts are wiped clean. Oil or lubricant is released\nbetweem parts that rub against each other, so\nthat there is less friction between them and the\nwearing is reduced. Machines are covered when\nnot in use to prevent dust settling on them. To\nprevent the effect of weather, metallic parts in a\nmachine are painted externally, and the machines\nare always kept dry.\n12.13 : Maintenance of machines\nDo you know?\nSM\nAlways remember...)\nBig factories have a separate\ndepartment for the maintenance\nof machines.\nFactories are closed at regular,\nfixed periods for the maintenance\n1 of machines.\nIf machines are not properly maintained\nthey will be of no use when we actually\nneed them.\nBefore we use a machine, we must learn\nhow to handle it properly so that there\nare no accidents.\nWhat we have learnt-\nMachines are used for reducing\nefforts, and doing more work in less\ntime.\nSome machines are simple while\nothers are complex.\n\u2022 The wedge, the lever, the inclined\nplane, the pulley and the wheel and\naxle are simple machines.\n\u2022 There are three types of levers based\non the positions of effort, load and\nfulcrum.\n\u2022 Machines should be maintained\nproperly to keep them in good working\ncondition.\nScience watch ...\nTo carry out a task efficiently, sometimes we have to use a trick.

What is the effect of\nthat action ?\nThe vibration of an object is necessary\nfor the production of sound. As long as the\nobject vibrates, the sound is heard. When the\nvibration stops, the sound also stops.\nThe object due to which sound is produced\nis called the source of that sound.\n- Try this.\nThe sounds of a sitar, a bell, water\nthat drops from a tap, a saucer that\nbreaks on falling down - what is it\nthat vibrates when these sounds are\nproduced ?\nDo you know?\n\u2014\nVoice box / Larynx\nAcoustics : The science of sound,\nresonance, including the production,\npropagation and effects of sound is\ncalled acoustics.

As the source of sound begins to vibrate, the\nlayer of air nearest to the source also vibrates. A wave of vibrations of that sound\nspreads in all the directions from the source of sound. Such a wave is called a sound\nwave. The sound waves reach our ears. There is a delicate diaphragm or eardrum in the\ncavity of our ears. It starts vibrating, too. The sensation produced by these vibrations\nare passed on to the brain through the nerves in the ears and we hear the sound.\nPropagation of sound\nLet's try this.\n1. Take two balloons.

Some\nof the sounds they depict are pleasant while others are harsh. Very loud or continuous\nnoise has adverse effects on the people of that locality. Their hearing may get impaired\nwhich can even lead to deafness. It can also cause restlessness, irritability and mental\nexhaustion. One cannot work with concentration. This kind of continuous noise which\nmay have ill effects is called noise pollution.\nNoise pollution\noccurs when we\nhear one or many\nsounds harmful\nto the ear.\nMeasures for preventing noise pollution\n1. As far as possible, we should avoid blowing the horn.\n2. The volume of the TV or radio in the house should be\nrestricted to those watching the programmes.\n3. Vehicles should be maintained properly to reduce the\nunnecessary sounds they produce.\n4.

Can we see anything in total darkness ?\n2. What helps us to see the objects around us ?\n3. What does the light in each one of the pictures\noriginate from?\n14.1 : Sources of light\nUse your brain power!\nThe objects or materials which emit light,\nmeaning those which themselves are a source of\nlight, are called luminous objects or materials.\nThe intensity of light is determined by the extent to\nwhich the objects emit light. For example, the light\nemitted by an electric torch is more intense than\nthat obtained from a candle.\nThe objects or materials that are not sources of\nlight themselves, are called non-luminous objects\nor materials.\nSome man-made objects or materials also emit\nlight. These are called artificial sources of light.\nThe Sun is the main natural source of light.\nOther stars seen in the night sky, fireflies, some\nanglerfish as well as honey mushroom are natural\nsources of light.\nMake a list of some luminous\n| objects and substances and\nclassify them into natural and\nartificial sources of light.\nThe propagation of light\nYou may have seen in the afternoon, rays of\nlight entering through a slit in a door or a small hole\nin the roof. As these rays of light from the slit or the\nhole move towards the floor, the dust particles in\ntheir way are seen clearly. Due to these particles,\nthe path of the light becomes visible and we can\nsee that their path is along straight lines.\n14.2 Light entering\nLet's try this.\nthrough a window\nTake three cardboards. Make a small hole in the centre of each cardboard using a thick\nneedle. Arrange the cardboards in such a way that the three holes are in the same line, as\nshown in figure 14.3 on page 98.

This is called the linear propagation of light.\nSource of light\nReflection of light\nHow do we see an object ?\nThe rays of light falling on an\nobject from a source of light are thrown\nback from the surface of that object. This\nis called reflection of light. We see the\nobject when the reflected rays reach our\nObject\neyes.\nDo you know?\nStars are luminous. Planets, satellites are\nnon-luminous. Sunlight reflected from the surface\nof the moon reaches us. That is how we can see\nthe moon. We call this light moonlight.\n14.5 : How an object is seen\n198\n. 1. In which objects\nUTC Can you tell? do we see a reflection?\n2. What is the difference between an object and\nits reflection ? What causes the difference?\nLet us see how light is reflected from the\nthree surfaces shown alongside.\nWhen you see your face in a mirror, the light reflected\nfrom your face falls on the mirror, and gets reflected back\nagain. That is why you see the image in the mirror.\nDo you see your image in a glass pane? You do,\nalthough it is somewhat faint. No image will be seen at\nall on a wooden surface.\nYou may have seen your image formed in surfaces such\nas a new steel dish, the glossy granite cladding of a wall\nand the still water in a lake. Make a list of other similar\nsurfaces. Compare the images seen in them. Make a guess\nabout the property of a surface due to which an image is\nformed. Discuss this with your teachers and parents.\n14.6 : An image\nLet's try this.\nImages in a plane mirror\nStand in front of a plane mirror and look at your image in it.\n1. Raise your right hand. Which hand of the mirror image\nis raised ?\n2. What change do you see in the image if you decrease or\nincrease your distance from the mirror ?\n3.

Spot them.\nDepending on the nature of the\nwindow pane, we may or may not see\nthe objects on the other side through it.\nIdentify the transparent, opaque\nand translucent objects from among the\nfollowing : piece of a glass, wax paper,\ntinted glass, oil paper, white plastic, a\ntea kettle, a notebook, cloth, water, a\nwooden cupboard, sheet of a notebook.\n14.9 : Window\n\u2022 The material through which light passes is said to be transparent.\n\u2022 The material through which light does not pass is said to be opaque.\n\u2022 The material through which light passes partially is said to be translucent.\nFormation of shadow\nLet's try this.\nTake an electric torch. Flash its light\non a wall. Now make your friend stand\nin between the torch and the wall.\nWhat happens ?\n(100)\n14.10 : Formation of a shadow\nIf an opaque object comes in the way of a light source, light does not pass through it.\nAs a result, the light does not reach a wall or any other surface on the other side of the\nobject. That part remains dark. This dark part is called the \u201cshadow of the object'.\nCompare this.\nCompare the objects in your environment with the shadows they form.\nB\nTry this.\nAsk your friend to stand at a certain distance from you in a\nbig room and obtain the shadow of your friend on the wall with the\nhelp of a torch. Now carry out the following actions. Observe and\nmake a note of the changes taking place in the shadow.\n1. Send the friend closer to the wall.\n2. Ask the friend to come towards you.\n3. Next, you move further away from him\nand towards him again.\n4. Hold the torch high and then low.\n5. Go toward the left and then to the right\nof the friend.\nThe shadow of an object is formed only when light does not pass through the\nobject. The kind of shadow it forms depends upon the relative distances between the\nsource of light, the object and the surface or the screen on which the shadow is formed.\nThe shadow of an object formed due to sunlight is long in the mornings and\nevenings and short in the afternoon. We can easily note these changes if we observe\nthe trees along the roadside. This change in the shadow depends on the source of light,\nthe object and also on the surface on which the shadow is formed.\n(101\nDo you know?\nA sundial : A sundial is an\ninstrument that indicates the time with\nthe help of the extent and the direction\nof the shadow of an object formed in\nsunlight. Earlier, time was measured\nby placing a stick parallel to the axis\nof the earth and by noting the position\nof its shadow on the dial at different\ntimes of the day. The largest sundial\nis at Jantar Mantar, New Delhi.\nThe research work presented by\nthe Indian scientist Sir C. V. Raman\nregarding scattering of light is known\nas the \u201cRaman Effect. He discovered\nthis effect on 28th February 1928.

The disc was fitted on a\nstand and rotated fast. As the\ndisc rotated, the seven colours\ndisappeared and only white was seen. This proved\nthat sunlight is made of seven colors. That is why,\nthe disc is known as Newton's disc.\nNewton wrote a book called \u2018Opticks' about light.\nThe shape of a shadow\ndepends upon the source\nof light, the object and\nthe surface on which it is\nformed. We should not get\nfrightened by the shadows\nwe see at night because\nthere is simple science\nbehind that.\nWhat we have learnt-)\nA substance that emits light is a source of light.\nThe natural sources of light are the sun, the stars, fireflies, etc. The lantern, the\nflame of a candle, an electric bulb, etc. are artificial sources of light.\nLight is propagated in a straight line.\nLight must be reflected from the surface of an object for the object to be seen.\nIf an opaque object obstructs the path of light, it casts a shadow.\n\u2022 White sunlight contains seven colours.\nScience watch ...\nMany questions arise in our mind while studying science; some easy, some\ndifficult. Where can we find the answers to them?\nDo not keep the questions to yourself. Keep asking those questions and look for\nthe answers. The store of knowledge is enormous. Glean as many particles of it as\nyou can.\nDid you ever wonder :\n\u2022 Why do we pucker our lips when blowing a candle out ?\nWhen we pucker our lips, we leave only a small space for the air to come out.\nThat increases the pressure on the air and it helps to put out the candle.\n( 103\nExercise\n3.

Take a mixture of sand, pieces of paper, sawdust,\niron filings and pins in a saucer and pass a magnet\naround the mixture. What do you see?\n15.3 : To identify the\nmagnetic materials\nwe use\nThe materials that stick\nto a magnet are called\nmagnetic materials,\nwhile those that do not\nstick to a magnet are\ncalled non-magnetic\nmaterials. The metals\niron, cobalt, nickel are\nmagnetic materials.\n(105)\nIn the past...\nThere is a legend about the discovery of\nmagnets. It is said that a shepherd named Magnes\nlived in Greece. Once, while his sheep were\ngrazing, he sat down on a big rock. But, what a\nsurprise he got when he tried to get up! His staff\nand his shoes were stuck to the rock. He had to\nuse great force to pull himself away from the\nrock.\nHe realized that what had happened was 15.4 : The story of Magnes\nbecause of the iron ferrule on his staff and the iron nails in his shoes. However, other\nrocks did not stick to his shoes or staff. Later, he showed the rock to everybody.\nThe rock was named magnetite after Magnes, the shepherd. Magnetite is a natural\nmagnet. It is also possible that the name \u2018magnet' came from Magnesia, the part of\nGreece where magnets were discoverd.\nFind out.\nHow is a mariner's compass used ?\nIt was known quite long ago to the people in China and Europe that a piece\nof magnetite, hung freely, always settled in the north-south direction. These rocks\nthen came to be used for finding the directions while travelling through unknown\nregions. That is why, they are also called lodestones (leading stones). This led to\nthe invention of the mariner\u2019s compass.\nMagnets can have a variety of shapes depending upon their uses. Today, magnets\nare used in many machines and gadgets or devices. They are all man-made magnets.\nFind out where the magnets shown in the pictures below are used.\nBar magnets, disc magnets, horseshoe magnets, ring-shaped magnets, cylindrical\nmagnets as also small button magnets are the different shapes of magnets in\neveryday use.\nHO\n15.5: Various man-made magnets\n( 106\nMagnetism\nWhen a magnet attracts an object, that object is displaced due to the magnetic force.\nIn places like factories, ports, garbage depots, large objects are shifted from place to place.\nFor this purpose, cranes with magnets are used. Work is done by magnetic force. This\nshows that magnetism is a kind of energy.\nCharacteristics of a magnet\n-\nY Let's try this.\n1. Determine the directions in the class or\nlaboratory. Tie a thread to the centre of a bar magnet\nand hang it from a stand. Note the direction in which\nthe magnet settles and turn it around again. Let it settle\nand note the direction. Do this many times.\nWhat do you observe ?\n15.6 : Direction in which the\nmagnet settles\nA magnet always settles in the north-south direction.\nThe end of a magnet that points to the north is called\nthe north pole while the end that points to the south is\ncalled the south pole. The north pole is indicated by\n'N' and the south pole, by 'S'.\n2. Place some iron filings on a sheet of paper and\npass a bar magnet over them. Pick up the bar magnet\nby holding it in the centre. What do you see?\nTo which part of the magnet do most of the iron\nfilings stick ? On which part do we see fewer filings?\nWhat can we conclude from this?\n15.7 : Magnetic power\nThe magnetic force is concentrated at the two\nends or poles of a magnet.\n3. Take a bar magnet that can be cut with scissors\nor a knife. Take iron filings on a sheet of paper and\nplace the magnet on it. Most of the iron filings will be\nseen to stick to its poles.\nNow cut the magnet into two pieces as shown in\nthe picture and place those pieces on iron filings. Pick\nup each of the pieces and observe them.\nWhat do you find ?\n15.8 : Characteristics of\nmagnetic poles\nIf a magnet is divided into two parts,\ntwo independent magnets are formed.\nIt means that the two poles of a magnet\ncannot be separated from each other.\n15.9 : More magnets from one\n(107)\n4. Fix a powerful bar magnet to a stand as\nshown in the figure. Fix an iron bar at a short\ndistance below the magnet. Take iron filings\nnear the iron bar. What do you see ?\nAfter some time take the magnet away.\nWhat happens now?\nIron filings stick to the iron bar when the\nmagnet is near it and fall off as soon as the\nmagnet is taken away. That is, the magnetism\nin the bar vanishes.\n15.10 : Induced magnetism\nA magnetic material acquires magnetism\nwhen placed near a magnet. This\nmagnetism is called induced magnetism.\nS\n5.

What\ndo you see?\nThere is repulsion between like poles\nof a magnet, while there is attraction\nbetween the opposite poles.\nS\nNS\n15.11 : Attraction and repulsion in magnets\n6. Take a needle or nail. Place it steady on\na table. Keep on rubbing a magnet over it from\none end to the other. Do this 7-8 times. Now take\na few pins near that needle/nail. What is seen ?\nIn this way, magnetic objects acquire\nmagnetism. Magnetism of this kind is temporary.\nIt lasts for a short while.\n15.12 : Artificial magnet\nA little fun!\n7\nMake an electromagnet\nApparatus : An iron nail of about 10 cm length\nand a 1-metre long insulated copper wire, a battery\ncell, pins or other magnetic objects.\nWind the copper wire around the nail as shown\nin the figure. Join both the ends of the wire to the\ncell. Now take the pins near the head of the nail.\nWhat do you see?\n15.13 : Electromagnet\n(108\nDuring the above activity\nwe saw that the pins stick\nto the nail. Now stop the\nelectric current and see what\nhappens. The pins sticking\nto the nail fall off. Why does\nthat happen ? Magnetism is\nproduced in the nail due to\nthe electric current. When\nit is put off, the magnetism\nvanishes. Such a magnet is\ncalled an electromagnet.\nThis magnetism is temporary.\nElectromagnetism is\nused in many places in our\nday-to-day life.\n15.14 : Use of electromagnet\nFor example, it is used in instruments\nsuch as a door bell and a crane.\nOn the other hand, the magnets fixed\nto a pin holder or the door of a cupboard\nare permanent magnets. Permanent\nmagnets are made from a mixture of\nnickel, cobalt and iron. For example, the\nmaterial alnico is a mixture of aluminium,\nnickel and cobalt.\nIn the past...\nThe British scientist Michael\nFaraday developed the technique of\nproducing electricity with the help of a\nmagnet.\nMichael Faraday was born in a\npoor family. As a young boy, he had\nto work with a book seller. There, he\nread many books and developed an\ninterest in science. Later, he went on to\ndo research at the Royal Institution in\nLondon. It is due to Faraday's research\nthat today we can use electricity\nand electromagnetism in innumerable\ninstruments in our day-to-day life.\n15.15: Maglev train\nThe properties of\nelectromagnetism and repulsion\nbetween magnets are used in a\nmaglev train. Due to the repulsion\nbetween the train and the rail the\nforce of friction does not come\ninto play and the train slides over\nthe rails with great speed. The\nmagnets fixed on the two sides of\nthe train help it to move forward.\nTo see how the maglev train\nworks, visit www.youtube.com\ntype maglev train, and click.\n(109)\nDo you know?\nThere is a strip of magnetic material in ATM\ncards, credit cards, etc. where necessary information\nabout the user is stored.\n803\nAUTHORISED SIGNATURE\nNOTALE FORET NOROC\nNOT VALID UNLESS SIGNED\nCANDUM\nMagnetic materials are also used to store data\nin the hard disk of a computer, an audio or video\ntape, etc.\nHow is magnetism destroyed ?\nMagnetism gets destroyed when a magnet\nis heated, thrown, knocked about or broken\ninto pieces. Therefore, it is important to store\nmagnets carefully. A piece of soft iron is placed\nin the box in which a magnet is kept. The bar of\nsoft or pure iron protects a magnet, therefore,\nsuch a bar is called a magnet keeper.\nMagnet keeper\n15.16 : Guarding a magnet\nPY Always remember...\nWhat we have learnt-\nVarious scientific discoveries,\nthe knowledge we gain through them,\nthe various instruments or gadgets we\ndevelop with its help are all useful\nfor the progress of man. They must\nbe used for the good of mankind.\nWe have to take precautions\nwhile working with electricity or with\nimportant devices.

This is the\nMilky Way. It is also known as \u201cMandakini'.\nA group of innumerable stars and their\nplanetary systems are together known as a\n'galaxy'. The Milky Way is the galaxy in\nwhich our solar system is located. The Milky\nWay is a part of the 'Local Group of galaxies.\nThere are many such galaxies in the universe.\nThe Milky Way includes many stars smaller\nthan our Sun as well as many others that are\nthousands of times bigger than the Sun. It\nalso includes many other celestial bodies such\nas clusters of stars, nebulae, clouds of gases,\nclouds of dust, dead stars, newly born stars, etc.\nThe galaxy that is closest to our Milky Way is\ncalled Andromeda.\n16.2: The Milky Way\nThe universe includes innumerable galaxies,\nthe space between them and also energy.\n16.3 : The Andromeda galaxy\n(112)\nTypes of galaxies : Various types identified according to their shapes\nIrregular\n16.5 : Hubble Telescope\nSpiral\nElliptical\nBarred spiral\n16.4 : Various galaxies\nThe scientist Edwin Hubble showed that there exist\nmany galaxies beyond our Milky Way. In 1990, NASA,\nthe American space agency launched the \u2018Hubble\nTelescope' in the orbit of the earth. The Hubble telescope\nhas made it easier to look for stars, to take photographs\nand to obtain spectrums.\nStars\nThe thousands of twinkling stars that we observe\nin the clear night sky are part of our Milky Way. Some\nof the stars that we see are bright whereas others are\nfaint. Stars radiating different colours such as blue,\nwhite, yellow and reddish can be seen in the sky. We\nalso see stars with varying brightness (luminance). The\nbirth place of stars are the huge nebulae, made of dust\nparticles and gases. Generally, the surface temperature\nof stars ranges from 3500\u00b0C to 50000\u00b0C. The colour of\nstars changes according to their temperature.\n16.6 : A nebula\nSome types of stars\n\u2022 Sun-like stars : These stars can be slightly smaller or bigger than the sun. But there is a lot\nof difference in their temperatures. Examples : stars like Sirius, Alpha Centauri.\n\u2022 Red Giants : The temperature of these stars ranges between 3000\u00b0C and 4000\u00b0C. But their\nluminance can be 100 times that of the sun. Their diameter is 10 to 100 times that of the sun\nand they are red in colour.\nSuper Nova : These are even brighter and larger than the red giant stars. Their temperature\nis between 3000\u00b0C to 4000\u00b0C but their diameter can be more than a hundred times greater\nthan that of the Sun.\n\u2022 Binary or Twin Stars : More than half of the stars in sky are binary stars. They consist of\ntwo stars that revolve around each other. At times, three or four stars that revolve around\neach other have also been located.\nVariable Stars : The luminance and shape of these stars is not stable. They are constantly\ncontracting or expanding. When a star expands, it emits less energy and at such times its\nbrightness decreases. As against this, when a star contracts, its surface temperature increases\nand the star emits greater energy and appears brighter. For example, Polaris (Pole Star).\n(113\nFind out.\nVisit the sites of the institutes ISRO (www.isro.gov) and NASA (www.nasa.\ngov) and collect information about the various celestial bodies in the solar\nsystem and universe, and discuss the same in the class.\nCan you tell ?\n1.
