No response.Statement of aim: in todays class we will study “ how to find the sum of the interior angle of nth polygon?”
What teacher doesWhat students will doWe shall learn this answer through an activity.
Now make a group of 4 to 5 members.
Now, listen students, I will show pictures on screen observe it, noteOk
Students will make group.
Ok mamdown in books then I will give time discuss in group and answer to my question.
Explore:
in geogebra Observe each stage
Express:
Each one of you have observed each stage start discuss in group what you have observed.
After few minutes teacher ask each group to tell what they have observed?
Answer will be elicited from each group.
