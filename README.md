# ML-Workbench
ML Workbench is a set of tools for developing and consuming Machine Learning Applications. The stated goals are:

* **Easy to initiate**: ML workbench will provide a ready-made libraries and documentation, that can enable even novice users to readily write new applications from scratch. 
* **Highly customizable**: The libraries will ensure that solutions are highly customizable, as the user can play and experiment with input parameters of APIs. It should enable addition, deletion or modification of intermediate steps.
* **Extensible**: ML Workbench library will allow users to add their own custom libraries, which would comply with the specified guidelines and conventions.
* **Automatically deployable**: The ML workbench will support creation of models and configuration files that can be directly used for deployment in production environment without further human intervention.
* **Scalable**: The ML workbench will enable creation of an end-to-end ML application, which would work on large scales of data, with high performance.
* **Repeatable**: The ML workbench will enable creation of applications, which are robust and consistent, i.e. given an identical dataset, they would produce identical results, without failures.
